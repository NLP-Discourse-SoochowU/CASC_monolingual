Some users express anxiety over the possibility of losing their homes or becoming refugees due to potential Russian aggression while others point out that international involvement is crucial for preventing further attacks. Users are largely against Russia waging war in Ukraine, and some users point out that even some Russian soldiers do not want to invade Ukraine. There are comparisons drawn between the current Russia-Ukraine conflict and the annexation of Crimea eight years ago, as well as opinion that the Russia-Ukraine conflict is a proxy for China and US tensions over Taiwan.

Others argue that it is necessary for national defense and should be done whenever there is a need for it. There are also concerns about the quality of training and inefficiencies in the SAF. Some users suggest cutting down the length of NS or providing more meaningful opportunities for NSFs.
