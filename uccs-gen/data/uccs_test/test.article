effort that's a lot of show to mask the lack of relevance).<br/><br/>is "not at this time" an alternative fact for "haven't been caught yet"? the washington post was the crucible of watergate. which one in the [currently] american free press will it be now? steele's dossier may be a good start. <S_SEP> russia's hacking of the u.s. election combined with trump's ceaseless praise of putin show something is rotten. <br/><br/>why will he not show his tax returns like every other modern president? why was he not force to show them? he is hiding something, and the citizens of america have a right to answers for their questions. republicans in the house are covering up for trump when they refuse to request his returns. their relentless witch hunts against hillary clinton forced the constant turn over of documents, emails, and everything else. but not one piece of paper from trump is requested although the business conflicts of interest with russia alone are enough to justify the review of the tax returns. more than a million people have signed the "we, the people" white house petition for trump to release his tax returns. kellyanne's response was "no" because no one was interested. excuse me? the wall street journal/nbc poll in january, 53% of americans wanted trump to release his taxes, and only 30% did not want him to.<br/><br/>the russian intelligence agency ties were basically playing with treason, conducted during the time the election was actively being hacked on trump's behalf. trump himself on the campaign trail asked the russians to hack hillary clinton. the constant communications from trump insiders with russia were obviously more likely to be nefarious given the situation than innocent foreign policy queries.<br/><br/>what did he know, and when did he know it? <S_SEP> for all of the speculation regarding russian hacking and possible collusion with the trump campaign there remains one salient fact; someone connected to the trump campaign made a concerted effort to change the gop platform to be soft on ukraine. other than this moment there no overt evidence of information flowing out to russia, it's wikileaks into the states.the gop remains the smoking gun of collusion, it's the signal to russia that trump is serious and willing. <S_SEP> let the leaks begin! nobody able to do so is going to willingly release trump's income tax statements. how much of a hush-up will the fbi be complicit with in the investigation of trump's campaign team had contact with russia? we know some things for certain. paul manafort, one of trump's top campaign officials, had to resign because a hand written diary of his financial dealings, presumably within the ukraine and/or with russia. i assume that none of the details of the contents of that diary have come to light not because they are not relevant, but rather, because they are most likely extremely dangerous to trump's fictionalized denial of the campaign team's allegedly improper communication with the russians. never mind that trump's understanding of models of inernational--indeed all affairs, domestic or foreign--are at the level of a child reading the names of model airplanes on the toy store shelf before choosing the one of greatest interest at the moment. there! now you've probably gotten a preview on some material that could be of interest to snl. but that's where fantasy and us policy coalesce. why? because trump's father was grandiose when older and died of dementia at 83. at 70, donald is not too young to show clear symptoms of dementia, starting with confusion of basic facts, to inability to follow narratives, to irritability and irrationality, to concrete thinking. the litany could continue indefinitely. but to what end? we must use the 25th amendment! <S_SEP> , russia and trump, election the circumstantial evidence is extremely strong the trump campaign colluded with the russians to steal the election. <br/><br/> trumps taxes will easily prove the ties to russia are indisputable. <br/><br/>revealing this complicity may jolt trumps followers back to reality and we can get on with the business of impeachment. <S_SEP> since we have not seen trump's personal nor corporate income tax returns nor trump's personal and corporate business records we do not know what russian president vladimir vladimirovich putin knows about trump's motives. putin is the trump master combination puppeteer and ventriloquist. and so are the 17 american intelligence agencies. <br/><br/>who can keep a secret? who can leak? <br/><br/>what do we the people not know and why don't we know it about trump's russian motives? <S_SEP> president donald trump is a dirty old man who is presently getting dirtier by the day. what a stench! “we see a lot of money pouring in from russia,” donald trump jr. was quoted as saying in 2008. russia may have gained leverage over trump through loans to his organization or other business dealings. the way to ease these suspicions would be to examine trump’s tax returns: any government investigation that doesn’t obtain trump’s tax returns simply isn’t a thorough investigation. what a stench in washington...we smell it all over north america. <S_SEP> well, the theory you deem "the flimsiest" (that russia has compromising evidence on trump) overlaps with the business conspiracy theory (that trump has business ties with the russians that he wants to keep secret). so this theory cannot be ignored even at this point. of course, real evidence is required for the first three of your potential conspiracy explanations and would be helped by the release of trump's tax returns so the feds could follow the money.<br/><br/>as to the "ideological alliance" explanation, it strikes me that the evidence already supports this motive as an underlying (and at least partial) explanation for trump's actions. the alt-right idolizes putin for the reasons you note. bannon is alt-right and was chosen by trump to run his campaign. he was also chosen by trump after the election to be his closest adviser. trump also made it a point during the election to court alt-right supporters (through dog whistles, racial innuendo and praise of putin). also, and perhaps most importantly, trump is himself an autocrat and goes out of his way (and maybe his mind) to denigrate democratic institutions such as a free press and an independent judiciary.<br/><br/>the ideological alliance explanation, already sufficiently proven, should alone be sufficient to question trump's motives and loyalties as president. and if the extent of his campaign's contacts with the russians had been known to the public before the election, he likely would not be president now. <S_SEP> we have decades of "facts" proving that trump has always been very shady in his dealings, to put it mildly. he has gotten away with dirty dealings and has developed an expectation that he always would. i don't think it's a stretch that he would continue with his practices and beliefs in his attempts to grab the biggest payoff of his life. what trump hasn't had before is hundreds, if not thousands, of investigative journalists, congressional hearings, fbi and us intelligence agencies all dedicated to rooting out the truth (i hope!). j.d. bolton has already cracked and confirmed that he was involved in changing the rnc platform with respect to the ukraine and that he did so on instructions directly from trump. trump is on record denying having any involvement.<br/>president eisenhower nearly got fred trump for his shameless profiteering on money meant to build housing for wwii vets: given today's information gathering technology i'm betting trump and his family enterprise will be brought low/to justice, finally.<br/><a href="http://edition.cnn.com/transcripts/1703/03/sitroom.01.html" title="http://edition.cnn.com/transcripts/1703/03/sitroom.01.html"

with all trumps blustering and lying its is hard to get to the truth when he tweets idiotic messages. <br/><br/>trump was a private citizen until he ran for office and trump tower was probably not the bastion of security before the secret service began guarding him. <br/><br/>it may well be the his offices were "tapped" or "bugged" long before he was elected. but not by our government. <br/><br/>his pal whom w called "puttie poot" putin may be found to be the culprit of the incursion into trumps space. the russians hacked the dnc and and interfered with the election so why not keep an eye on their favorite candidate while he was trashing the country. having found the russian "bugs" trump deflects the blame to obama, how convenient. <br/><br/>there is a reason why he is hiding his tax returns and it has nothing to do with an audit. follow the money nyt. <S_SEP> , ukraine and trump affair republican efforts to focus on leaks rather than on russia/trump campaign collusion is an obvious diversion. otherwise, they would have to ask actual questions about the subject of the investigation, trump. <br/><br/>in private, none of these republicans like trump any more than do democrats. whether trump's big push on trumpcare will get it passed in the house will tell us much. if not, which is probable, then we'll know that trump has become a lame duck quacking desperately on twitter.<br/><br/>the fact that the most recent polls show trump with only a 37% approval rating, down 8 points in a week, tells us he is losing support among republicans. his approval among democrats was already only 6%. the reduction has to come from republicans. <br/><br/>that tells house republicans is they should abandon trump without quite yet attacking him. they just need to neutralize him, pending the investigation. <br/><br/>the fbi will find at least one person, e.g., a roger stone type, who can be charged with a criminal offense whose loyalty is only to himself. if that person can be traded immunity for testimony against close trump campaign and personal advisors sufficient to convict them, then it will be over. someone on the inside is going to have to turn state's evidence to bring down trump, and that person will be found.<br/><br/>once it all starts to crumble, no one will take a bullet for trump. in the end, he will be impeached and removed. but trump's narcissism will be served; he will be remembered forever. <S_SEP> financial...trump has a long history of business talks with russia. his son said a disproportionate amount of trump business was with russia and great amounts of money in 2008. trump gets funding thru deutsche bank which is now paying millions in fines to the us for russian money laundering. trump's buildings in the us have dubious russian backing.<br/>congress must get trump's financial records as a baseline for any investigation into his campaign's ties with russia. did russia directly contact trump? probably not--his truth problem makes direct negotiation difficult for russia also. however, he surrounded himself with russian-tied people in both campaign and his admin. the gop congress must do their duty as per the constitution (think they remember that document these days?) in overseeing the exec. closing your eyes, willfully blind, violates their oaths of office in putting party loyalty above that owed to our nation. <S_SEP> the most important 'thing' in this whole russian hacking scandal is that there be an independent and thorough investigation.<br/>while many dots are being identified and lined up, none of that will matter if there is an investigation that is compromised. with the republicans in total control of washington and comey having identified previously whose side he is on, having 'faith' that the truth will be discovered is a fool's errand.<br/>until such time as trump becomes too hideous even for mcconnell, the gop will probably not lift a finger.<br/>it remains to the fourth estate and a few voices in congress to keep pushing for the truth of the matter. while i agree that manafort is very suspect, it is more important to have the investigators actually do the work than it is to call out specific players at this time.<br/>the woodward and bernstein's of this world have their challenge before them.<br/>it's time to get to work when the gop keeps stalling and hiding. <S_SEP> mr. leonhardt, what the country needs today are bob woodward and carl bernstein, the two journalists who broke the watergate story that toppled a president who was as unfit for the oval office then as is the current occupant. it's no co-incidence that both presidents loathed the press and the protections of the first amendment. they serve as a democracy's checks and balance on elected officials, especially when a president angrily pushes back on reporters who are only doing their jobs. as the saying goes, where's there's smoke, there's fire.<br/><br/>that this president has something to hide in his relationship and financial dealings with russia is obvious. his refusal to release his tax information sounds an alarm that republicans in the senate and house should heed and investigate as soon as possible. we the people don't know what the president has swept under his rug and maybe republicans don't care but citizens who have inquiring minds want to know. <br/><br/>come clean, mr. president. you're wrong when you say that your tax returns are none of our business. you ran for the presidency because you said you wanted to serve us. now is the time to show us that you meant what you said. <S_SEP> "[w]hen a leader goes berserk and unleashes tirades and threats at investigators, that’s when you’re getting close." this is exactly right. this was my first thought re: trump's 6:35 a.m. "obama bugged me" nonsense. the early morning hour, the abject craziness of the accusation, bespeak a rising hysteria. to my mind, the smoking gun -- the conclusive evidence of collusion -- occurred last summer during the gop convention. here we have a candidate, trump, singularly uninterested and uncurious about policy issues of any nature: let alone the obscure (to most americans) issue of whether the u.s. should provide the ukrainians with anti-tank missiles and over-the-horizon radar to better defend against russian aggression. and yet, this was the only gop platform issue with which trump operatives involved themselves -- the only one -- and did so in a way entirely consistent with kremlin interests. (putin is intensely concerned about the ukrainians being effectively armed because this means more russian soldiers coming home in body bags and, consequently, more domestic resistance to his invasion of ukraine.) there simply is no rational explanation for the trump effort to change the original gop position in favor of arming the ukrainians other than a quid pro quo between trump and putin. it certainly wasn't for u.s. political reasons because most americans (especially trump voters) can't locate ukraine on a map and couldn't care less about what happens to this country. <S_SEP> if one uses as a premise the fact that “trump speaks his mind” (it is the “shoot first – aim/think later” trait in trump), then there may be truth to the third reason identified by mr. leonhardt. as examples, we have seen trump say things like “the press is the enemy”, only to have mr. pence say the opposite. we have seen trump essentially question the need for nato, only to have his secretary of defense say the opposite. some may observe that this is a volitional trump tactic to “negotiate”. on the other hand if it demonstrates his uncontrollable inability to keep quiet (he is – after all – unaccountable), then saying such things like russian hackers should locate the 30,000 missing emails, and having paul manafort as a manager, perhaps leads to evidence of knowledge he had at the time. it may take an effort to connect the dots to show a political conspiracy to coordinate efforts with russian intelligence, but if that is accomplished then mr. pence will be president of the united states <S_SEP> also, as rachel maddow reports almost every night, one by one, the claims in the christopher steele dossier are, unbelievably, panning out, including the quick return of an official in the russian embassy in washington back to russia (the one responsible for paying for the dnc hacking), and another shadowy russian figure who traveled twice to the u.s. before the election by his own admission expressly to influence the russian-ukraine position on the republican platform. (he was successful). <S_SEP> why havent trump's tax returns been leaked? with everything else that has been leaked, i find this curious. any thoughts? <S_SEP> the damage that has been done to our nations reputation by<br/>trump cannot be overestimated. looking at merkel sitting next<br/>to trump speaks volumes. it is time for a special prosecutor .<br/>everyday that this story is present the russians gain even more<br/>rewards for their cyberwar. i am very concerned that there are<br/>those within the administration that will try and create a distraction<br/>that is so large attention is drawn away . we must not underestimate<br/>bannon's ideological passion to deconstruct. there is definitely<br/>something out there. there is a foul stench to all of this that will<br/>not go away. seeing the adoring crowds at the latest trump<br/>rally in kentucky i ask when will those people wake up? comey<br/>certainly dropped the ball regarding clinton during the campaign.<br/>he has an obligation to the nation to pursue the investigation to<br/>wherever it leads. this a dangerous time for our country because<br/>it is clear that trump is clearly divorced from reality. he is living<br/>in his own bubble a legend in his own mind. it could<br/>be that the incompetency of this administration will rival that<br/>of harding nearly 100 years ago. it may be that the criminality<br/>may surpass that of nixon. one more point i do not believe that<br/>the trump team has the ability or desire to counter the russian<br/>cyber warfare program. <S_SEP> there's a new scandal in town. trump's easily refuted claim that obama was wire-tapping him has turned the scandal around. people are now wondering just how much monitoring of the trump campaign the obama administration was doing and whether the data gleaned from that bugging is being used illegally to subvert the trump administration in its early days. <br/><br/>the times itself has gone so far as to change a headline long after publication of a very important story it ran on jan. 20: <br/><br/>read more at: <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445628/barack-obama-donald-trump-fbi-wiretap-russia" title="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445628/barack-obama-donald-trump-fbi-wiretap-russia" target="_blank">http://www.nationalreview.com/article/445628/barack-obama-donald-trump-f...</a><br/><br/>there never was any evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and the russians to fix the election or hack democrats who were clueless about internet security. but there was apparently monitoring of people in the trump campaign by an administration who had a huge stake in the outcome of the election and who, while trying to frame trump associates, was going ridiculously easy on the obvious criminality of the democrat candidate, even after it was discovered that the attorney general met secretly with her husband who just happened to be a former president of the united states. <S_SEP> i'm embarrassed for my country. trump is using his presidential power to crush all investigations into his russian ties and corrupt business dealings and, in turn, using certain heads of investigative agencies and members of congress to shield that corruption. trump is lashing out and attacking one of the best presidents this country ever had and he is determined to destroy all of his policies as well. when history writes about this, no one will be able to understand how so many people were so ignorant and vulnerable to corruption when it came to donald trump. in the meantime, while all the investigations are being held at bay, journalists and intelligent americans are connecting the dots all on their own. the trump administration cannot successfully contain their secrets much longer, and in the future, there will be a list of names that were responsible for protecting trump and his "associates." <S_SEP> tony schwartz who helped trump with the art of the deal, said trump despises obama because he knows deep down that he can never be him. and it's true, he can't. this explains why trump spent 4 years trying to bring obama down with his bogus birther claim and his ridiculous insistence that his inauguration crowd was bigger than obama's.<br/>now he's won the same prize obama won, the white house. but seven weeks in trump is not doing well. a washington post journalist said trump is haunted by obama, comparing obama's accomplishments to his own during the same time period. he hasn't been able to do what obama did. and the work is hard. and his skill set isn't a good fit for the job.<br/>why would mr trump work with the russians? if you don't think his obama obsession figured in mr trump's dealings with russia, consider what's in that increasingly verified dossier. mr trump insisted on staying in the same russian hotel suite the obamas had stayed in and invited guests urinate on the bed.<br/>our country should not be dragged into the netherworld of mr trump's psyche but sadly, we are. <S_SEP> typically income tax returns do not shed light on sources of lending for a non public entity. so that suggestion is weak as to substantiating a theory. and it is a theory in terms of speculation about mr. trump.<br/>obama and clinton both had an objective of re-setting the russian relationship but some how that is different? you may recall the open mic incident where obama made some sort of promise to medvedev about his flexibility regarding something. no one in the press ever asked a question so we still don't know what that meant. biased and misleading "journalism" is a real problem in america. suddenly the press is consumed with conspiracy theories.<br/>and it seems perfectly acceptable to them that clinton enabled an entangled set of transactions benefiting russia with regard to uranium.<br/>suspicion is not unwarranted some times but attempting to justify it without facts does nothing productive. but that represents the coverage of the new president by the predominately liberal media which results in his open disdain for them. not surprisingly their penchant for playing loose with the facts only further solidifies mr. trump's support by fair minded people outside the bubble of far left dictates. <S_SEP> the investigation into trump's campaign and russian influence must continue as a priority until we truly know what happened. <S_SEP> people seem to forget that putin came out and publicly said that trump was the best candidate. trump said putin was a strong leader and has been noticeably reluctant to criticize him. that's all the communication that was really needed between the two. <br/><br/>trump has visited russia in the past and i'm sure the russian elite discussed us-russian relations with him at the time and liked what they heard. putin's hatred for hillary has been known for years.<br/><br/>a secret meeting would have been a completely unnecessary risk for both sides. trump is known to favor better relations with russia. putin's hatred for hillary was probably all the motivation he needed to try to harm her. <S_SEP> and could we investigate whether the trump empire was involved in money laundering for russians? <S_SEP> one way that trump's tax returns might become available would be through a lawsuit by president obama as a private citizen against trump for defamation of character and libel, and asking for a huge amount of money as compensatory and punitive damages, for example $100 billion. in such a suit, if president obama prevailed, trump's finances could be an issue in setting damages at an appropriate level. <br/><br/>president obama could donate some or all of the recovered funds to charities and non-profits that trump does not like, such as planned parenthood, the aclu and others.<br/><br/>that would serve trump right for making unfounded and factually unsupported allegations. <S_SEP> if only connecting the dots is all that is need for the country as a whole to stand up and say 'he has to go', but in these times facts are relative to a person's wishes and beliefs. trump's tweets seem to be more real to many people than anything a commission or a government agency might say. <br/><br/>trump has a way of wiggling out of his problems leaving someone else holding the bag. likely, one of his associates will take the fall should one need to be taken. <br/><br/>meanwhile, the republicans will not want to rock their party boat as it floats on a steady stream of trump fueled frenzy. they will protect him at all costs because planning for a future that is longer than 2 years is not in their makeup. <br/><br/>would the trump tax returns have a line item that says russian money. i doubt the tax returns would reveal much since the international business community has more ways than a slot machine to shuffle money around. trump never has honored tax rules. <br/><br/>patriotic democrats and republicans are only going to be left with the anxiety and heartburn that trump and his lacks in congress cause as they dance around truth and ooze hypocrisy. <S_SEP> the trump people believed that disclosure of their contacts with the russians would be detrimental to trump's campaign, so they were deceptive and misled anyone who inquired. if trump actually thought that he would be elected, he might have been more careful. once the election was over and he was on to his next venture, it would be unlikely that anyone would care about any contacts with the russians, so long as there was no actual collusion. when people think that they can do things without being held accountable, they can do a lot for which they would not want to be held accountable. so it would seem likely that if the russians were conversing with the trump people but the trump people were not doing more than being informed. if in fact, trump or his people were actually joining in with the russians to make this all happen, then those involved likely broke some laws and should be prosecuted. <S_SEP> the appointment of a special prosecutor and select investigative committee is now mandatory.<br/><br/>the democrats, through their statements and questions, presented a compelling circumstantial case concerning trump's ties to russia, his conflicts of interest and his vulnerability to manipulation--even coercion--by the foreign interests to whom he is indebted. these foreign interests, granted what we already know concerning the donald's past behavior, also may have the embarrassing bases for black-mailing our sitting president.<br/><br/>this situation is unprecedented.<br/><br/>the republican members of the committee, following the lead of their distractor-in-chief, pursued the course of misdirection and obfuscation. the gop committee members were very concerned to root out those whistleblowers who, by their leaks, called attention to the russian connections of president trump and his campaign associates--many of whom were appointed to powerful positions within the trump administration.<br/><br/>president trump, if you have nothing to hide, please release your tax returns. members of the house intelligence committee, if trump continues to hide his tax returns and since nothing else will clarify this situation, please subpoena trump's tax returns.<br/><br/>fox news will need a boxcar full of lipstick to prettify this monstrous pig of a situation. <S_SEP> mr. leonhardt, you define your fourth explanation -- "russia has compromising material on trump" -- too narrowly. the "compromising material" need not involve "a dossier compiled by private investigators" at all. if the trump campaign solicited russian intelligence to hack the dnc, then "russia has compromising material on trump" on that issue. if trump is financially beholden to russian interests and has been lying about these obligations (and why he is withholding his tax returns) for months, then "russia has compromising material on trump" on that issue.<br/><br/>it is akin to the sordid relationship j. edgar hoover once had with some high-ranking u.s. politicians. the politicians would solicit hoover's aid in compromising a political opponent -- and then hoover would turn right around and use their solicitation of him as a threat, gaining him personal job security and virtually unlimited funding for the fbi.<br/><br/>whatever "business conspiracy" or "political conspiracy" trump may have engaged in with the russians, the proof of such a conspiracy is "compromising material on trump" possessed by the russians with which they can exact favorable treatment. <S_SEP> "trump's determined emphasis not to release his tax returns is a clear and very obvious indication that he is hiding unsavory activities that could seriously damage his presidency."<br/><br/>i consider my tax returns private. it is no ones business how much my family makes, what charitable giving we do, whether or not our medical expenses are high enough to write off, etc. our tax returns would reveal no unsavory activities yet we don't care to share them.<br/><br/>many people hate president trump and he is constantly attacked. i an imagine the wild speculations his opposition would fabricate. i voted for president trump and hope he never releases his taxes because it would be such a major distraction. after seeing the false russian collusion narrative, complete with criminal leaks, and that people have raised impeachment funds since before he took office, i am convinced that many people are obsessed with destroying him.<br/>i hope decent people will continue to push back against these unjustified attacks.<br/><br/>john <S_SEP> what do the russians have on donald trump? <S_SEP> let's try the simplest answer. we know trump's primary interest is himself and primarily his own monetary gain; we know he operates on other people's money; we know he doesn't really have any policy stances on domestic or foreign affairs; we know that trump is secretive about his personal finances (not releasing his tax returns). trump doesn't care enough about putin's or russia's policies or ambitions and doesn't have the attention span to think about them for very long. it just seems most probable that trump's involvement with putin and russians is most likely financial - maybe involving business opportunities but most probably debt related. <S_SEP> 2 weeks ago pulitzer-prize winning watergate reporter carl bernstein said the real heroes of watergate were republican senators who put the survival of our democracy before partisan concerns &amp; helped form a special select committee to investigate watergate. in short order, alexander butterfield revealed the oval office taping system which lead to nixon's impeachment &amp; resignation.<br/><br/>does the current gop care nothing about national security, our international reputation as a stable democracy? does it matter trump claimed obama committed a felony by taping him - with no evidence that happened &amp; intelligence officials &amp; law enforcement debunking his claim? the gop is the party in power. is the gop going to hold the president accountable for his disreputable behavior that undermines our democracy, threatens national security, trashes the reputation it's taken decades for the u.s. to build as a paragon of freedom &amp; democracy that can be trusted by other countries to keep it's word &amp; serve as a democratic model?<br/><br/>does trump own the gop - &amp; america - so that he can tear our country apart, endanger our freedom &amp; undermine our security because to the gop tax cuts are more important than democracy surviving? at the least, does the gop have so little regard for our military that trump will eventually send on a mission? don't our troops deserve a commander-in-chief they can trust if they're sent to fight &amp; die on foreign soil? instead of a nut, liar &amp; possible russian collaborator? <S_SEP> republicans have no problem with russia hacking hillary clinton's campaign emails - that's how they won the presidency.<br/><br/>democrats need to find another way to subpoena trump's tax returns. <S_SEP> kristof's "momentous" editorial is worthy of the pulitzer prize. it is not easy, and takes courage to "connect the dots" of a monumental scandal when the republicans, who are in the majority in congress, are stonewalling the investigation, and even participating in "fake news" by appearing regularly on unbalanced and unfair fox news.<br/><br/>there may not be a single smoking gun to implicate the president, but multiple smoldering guns correlated with the many contacts between trump associates and russian officials and business people connect to the russian government and putin.<br/><br/>one must understand trump's (paranoid) mindset prior to the election. he like most everyone else thought he was going to lose. this may have led trump and his associates to cross the line to gain an unfair advantage over his opponent, hillary clinton. when trump asked the russians to hack ms. clinton's emails it was viewed by many as a joke. as the scandal unfolds, his<br/>freudian slip may be seen as trump's moment of truth. <S_SEP> , claire mccaskill lets' investigate!! senator claire mccaskill, democrat of missouri, was caught red-handed meeting with the russian ambassador-and lying about it!!!! clearly, she is a kgb spy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <S_SEP> how the republicans could only ask comey the questions about leaking information about “those who shall not be named” with a straight face when there appears to be invasion of trump’s campaign by russian sympathizers at the very least is beyond me. house republicans complained about damage to national security by leaks revealing that national security adviser michael flynn committed perjury when questioned by the f.b.i. about conversations with russian officials before he took office. are you kidding me? no house republicans are concerned about the potential for russian influence before the election or afterwards? <br/><br/>republicans should have at least given the appearance about concern for the electoral integrity and the possibility of russian influence after the election. they just “circled the wagons” and looked like they have absolutely no interest in anything that could possibly impact national security unless hillary clinton was involved. <S_SEP> what about the tax returns of donald trump's immediate family? because trump works so closely with his three oldest children their tax returns might also contain data that would help explain trump's admiration for russia.<br/><br/>ivanka trump visited some former and not-so-former russian countries. is there a basis for requesting her and her husband jared kushner's tax returns. they have assumed public roles and are using donald trump's position as president to further their own business goals. surely, this cannot be legal! <S_SEP> additional indications of a trump-russian connection are found in documents in the trump soho project litigation and the trump baku tower deal. both show investments by russian and russian-allied oligarchs and corrupt individuals, and in the trump baku deal, the possible participation of the iranian revolutionary guard. there are indications that trump has been laundering money for years for such interests, which is a criminal, if not, treasonous act. trump may also have a large debt to settle with putin and his agents. <S_SEP> trump's motive with russia is money.<br/><br/>trump cares only about money.<br/><br/>he names as secretary of state a man who would earn exxon a sweet $50+ billion deal with russia if sanctions are lifted.<br/><br/>trump's bonus: a sweet 10 percent.<br/><br/>trump is not a sophisticated or deep thinker.<br/><br/>he is a failed businessman in many of his attempts.<br/><br/>he goes bankrupt to save himself, over and over again.<br/><br/>this is just about money, folks.<br/><br/>nothing else to see. <S_SEP> to me, the question is, what happens if we find out all this is true? are there people planning what will will happen if trump has to be prosecuted, or removed from office? <S_SEP> if mr. trump has nothing to hide, he should not urge the f.b.i. to drop the matter. rather, he should welcome the investigation to clear him. <S_SEP> with republicans trying to cover for trump and his administration, i can't help but wonder, just how far do ties to russia go? <S_SEP> the trump circle simply has not behaved as if they are innocent. they are behaving as if they have things to hide. <S_SEP> don't the facts about between russians, the trump campaign and the trump administration suggest a simple hypothesis: one or more russian agents have controlled or manipulated trump for a long time and aim to undermine key functions of the u.s. government and the press? <S_SEP> yesterday, trey gowdy's disgusting attempts to discredit the vitally important leaks that are blasting open the corruption that is the trump presidency, reveals that a large part of the republican party is just as corrupt and power hungry as donald trump. gowdy tried again and again and again to discredit any and all evidence garnered through leaks of the illegal and possibly treasonous actions by trump's innermost staff.<br/>as others have pointed out, it's like claiming "deep throat" mark felt was the real criminal for leaking that watergate was a vast attempt to corrupt the 1972 election.<br/>but why be surprised? gowdy wasted 11 hours and millions of tax-payer dollars grilling hillary clinton on the nothing-with-nothing emails and got nowhere, except perhaps reassuring unsure supporters of clinton's capability.<br/>gowdy tried, as did trump that the real criminals are not only the leakers but the press that published them. yet again, republicans like trump and gowdy (i refuse to ever refer to him as anything other than trump or "the president" but i never connect "president" and "trump").<br/><br/>it's really terrifying that so many republicans are so caught up with the immediacy of "our team, good; their team, evil" that they refuse to recognize that a hostile foreign power with a meglomaniac kleptocratic leader intimately acted to influence our nation's election. it was not their first nor their last interference in other nation's elections. ask holland and france! <S_SEP> the times had no problem when president obama meddled in the investigation into hillary clinton, declaring publicly, before the investigation was concluded, that while clinton may have mishandled classified materials, her conduct did not compromise national security. and, lo and behold--surprise, surprise--the fbi finds that in fact clinton did mishandle classified materials, but--wait for it--it did not rise to the level of being prosecutable, even though she had over a thousand classified documents, including special access, top secret documents on her home-brew server, all of which had been transmitted over unclassified networks.<br/><br/>the times had no problem when president obama publicly declared during an ongoing investigation of how the irs targeted his political opponents that there was not even a "smidgeon" of corruption.<br/><br/>the times never once called for a special prosecutor or a select committee during the eight years of the obama presidency.<br/><br/>the reason we have donald trump is because the mainstream media, and especially the ny times, colluded with the obama administration to allow them to get away with politicizing the justice department, the fbi, and the irs. most of the opponents of the obama administration have decided that they will not live by the same standard. you helped kill accountability and the truth in our society. now you have the chutzpah to complain about it. <S_SEP> thank you mr kristof for reminding us to keep our cool. this is a nuanced situation and one that the politics of a polarized red state, blue state mentality cannot effectively solve. although there is much to dislike about sessions, you're right in saying that we need to stay focused and, to use a phrase from watergate, "follow the money." <br/><br/>we have helped to create a very unstable situation by allowing a dictator of a relatively small state like russia to maneuver into a power position over a much larger wealthy state like ours. there is no question of the atrocities that putin has presided over and that even though the us has it's share of nefarious deeds in our history. however, we should also avoid getting pulled into the 'we did it too' ruse that trump has tried to distract us with.<br/>our two-faced gop leaders, mcconnell and ryan, as well as the rank and file gop that stay in lock step with them, are only making a solution more difficult to find. how do we get an electorate to stop believing trump's (and the gop's) outright lying more than evidence based journalism? it seems like an intractable problem. maybe the clumsy actions of the trump administration made during and after the election will force the system to lurch toward solving the problem, but the odds aren't looking too good. <S_SEP> any collusion is more likely to have been initiated by russia. they are the ones who meddled in the election. that is, it is more likely that the russians manipulated trump's people. it is trump who is the naive one when it comes to trump v. putin. in other words, there was no conspiracy beyond attempts by trump and manafort to make money dealing with russia. that still leaves trump in a compromised position. <S_SEP> , orders on the state department, trump in addition, at the time of the rnc, trump denied he had anything to do with this one change in the platform. but we know now from another campaign official that this official made the change on trump's order. it sure looks like a cover-up of wrong-doing. otherwise, why lie? and putin (as rachel maddow has pointed out) could still be influencing our country by having trump gut the state department staff and not replacing them. it makes sense. quid pro quo. is trump still taking orders from putin because of putin's help with the election? we need to get answers soon. <S_SEP> the hacked democratic national committee email revealed that dnc leaders worked to ensure bernie sanders didn’t upset hillary clinton in the democratic primary. the assertion that this “revelation” cost hillary the presidential election is laughable. the email that hurt clinton was the email found on her private server, and it was the new york rimes—not the russian or wikileaks—that broke the news about the server’s existence. now the new york times appears to be attempting to atone for the damage done.<br/><br/> assertions that russian propaganda efforts help donald trump win the election are equally absurd. the intelligence community report concluded that putin stopped saying nice things about trump because the russians realized it was backfiring against trump. hillary made the trump’s alleged ties with putin relationship a major talking point in debates and in her campaign speeches. russia cost trump votes. <S_SEP> trump and the russians is "deja vu all over again" for the republicans. one doesn't have to look all that far back to recall the secret deal between the republicans and iran to exchange spare parts for their american-based military hardware in exchange for not letting the hostages go from the embassy until reagan was sworn in. the ongoing crisis doomed the chances of jimmy carter's second term, much as the various leaks now doomed the chances of hillary clinton's first. so collusion with foreign powers to steer election results is nothing new for republicans. but, to be fair, democrats allegedly colluded with the mafia to help put kennedy over the top in illinois in 1960.<br/><br/>as much as we entertain the fantasy of "free and fair" elections, they are as much games of psychological warfare on both sides to steer the course one way or another. from the examples above to the "swift boats," to the citizens united decision, various big power players are now regular participants in the campaign process. and we're none the better for it. but can we shut the barn doors after all the cows are out? and at that point does it even matter? for we've all been gored by the whole circus the process has become. <S_SEP> how sour it is! republicans were overjoyed when leaks appeared regarding the benghazi investigation, and donald j. trump was elated with the wikileaks hillary clinton and podesta leaks. when the shoe pinches on the other foot, however, leaks to the press and public are horrors of criminality. however, as the house hearing today demonstrated, the real horror may be what transpired (and may still be transpiring) between donald j. trump, the trump organization, the trump campaign and putin's russia. the trump administration and most republicans will surely spin and delay, obfuscate and mislead in an attempt to drag the process out at least beyond the next election or even until after the 2020 campaign is over. to expect a truly independent investigation in the hypocritical atmosphere of today's political quagmire may be a genuine exercise in wishful thinking. one hopes for some elected men and women of integrity to step forward. until then, let the leaks continue, wherever they may flow.<br/>doug giebel<br/>big sandy, montana <S_SEP> door #4 is tempting but relies too heavily on the idea that 45 thought any of this through in advance. please. he's not that clever. <br/><br/>instead, its way more likely that putin stalked a desperate (on account of greed) businessman, framed him up good with kompromant extraordinaire - and then, a perfect storm did the rest. <br/><br/>after he's caught by the you know whats, and the perfect storm crashes america, the kremlin directs their puppet (hillary called it well!) from mockba. <br/><br/>rex "65 million acres of rusky oil exploration rights" tillerson gets cherry picked for state. tom "don't worry about sanctions" flynn gets nsa and dumbdumb rick "oops" perry gets the (nuclear) energy department he couldn't even recall!!<br/><br/>and america is sitting around wondering about the motive?? the motive would be interesting to learn but it is irrelevant as we are the victims of a double-reverse coup d'etat. <S_SEP> i think the mostly likely explanation is that russia/putin has financial leverage on trump. they propped up his business when no one else would. trump's worst nightmare is not being seen as wealthy and successful. russia/putin/oligarchs have the ability to bankrupt trump by calling in loans. trump doesn't have enough assets to cover his debt. he'll be broke. and we'll all know it. worst nightmare!<br/><br/>that's why putin wanted him elected - absolute leverage over the american president. <S_SEP> getting $$ is the motive in every trump action and has been his whole life. among trump's appointees and entourage with russian ties, $$ was changing hands. among trump's appointees without russian ties, getting wealthy on other people's $$ and directing it to candidates and causes that preserve their $$ is how their system works. of course, grabbing tax $$ collected for the public good and handing it over to private business and corporations has been and continues to be not just the trump way but the republican way. trump is just more bold and shameless about it. the $$ protest sign pictured above this analysis says it all: follow the $$. <S_SEP> , trump's tax returns, senate leadership trumps pandering putin and russia is over the top. it is the job for responsible republicans in the senate to start an investigation that will subpoena trumps tax returns as well as those that have lied about russian ties. the importance of this action is of the ultimate. our democracy, our political system and our future demands it. trumps stonewalling with the support of senate and house leaders are putting the country in peril. <br/><br/>i understand the republican leaders in the senate wanting to use the power of a republican president to advance their agenda. getting trump out of there will not jeopardize that agenda, only postpone it. they will still have a republican president. <S_SEP> first of all, nick, this is simply ridiculous -- the innuendo, the false claims, the dots that don't connect except in the fevered brains of progressives.<br/><br/>2 -- russia did not steal the election. the worst that happened was that some embarrassing e-mails were released. show me one vote that was changed because of wiki-leaks revelations.<br/><br/>3 -- trump hadn't put his hat in the ring until july 2015 and was considered a side show at that point. and that was around the time that whoever hacked the dnc - hacked. makes no sense that russia &amp; trump were working together at that time.<br/><br/>4 -- we have no hard proof the russians hacked the dems. we have the judgment of intelligence officials who didn't like trump for the most part and were under tremendous political pressure from obama to make a report.<br/>and we now know our cia can hack someone and make it look like someone else (russians) did it. <br/><br/>5 -- the "russian" dossier was garbage - you know it. fake news.<br/><br/>6 -- there was nothing illegal about flynn's contact with the russian ambassador. nor were sessions contacts illegal.<br/><br/>7-- would it surprise you if in 2016, once it was clear trump would win the nomination russians would want to get to know trump and his team?<br/>anything illegal there?<br/><br/>8 -- all reports from gov sources say there was no collusion<br/><br/>9 -- why would trump collude in any way with russia on this? where's the motive? <br/><br/>all you have are dots, most imaginary. you have not made a case for connecting lines. <S_SEP> , russia and u.s. taxation system =======<br/><br/>we just did our taxes. we were struck by the fact that one is asked directly whether one has had foreign assets, foreign accounts, funds in foreign banks, etc. and, if so, to document them, amounts, interest, foreign profits and taxes, etc. <br/><br/>this is why trump's tax returns are so important. <br/><br/>they will either show the deep russian bank and russian financial connections-- or, they could be grounds for perjury if it turns out that he lied about such assets on his forms. <br/><br/>we're pretty confident that, over the years, it will turn it to have been a mixture of the two!<br/><br/>show us your taxes, mr. so-called president!<br/><br/>"show us the money!"<br/><br/>===== <S_SEP> he's a traitor, and so are all he cronies who have russian ties. get them all out of the white house. congress: get a hold of donald trumps tax returns, and let's see what's going on, once and for all. either he's guilty, or he's not. i say guilty. <S_SEP> congressional republican seditionists spent several years and at least $10 million investigating an attack on the american diplomatic compound in the libyan outback by islamic militants.<br/><br/>they also spent a lifetime and small fortune researching hillary's emails.<br/><br/><a href="http://askedandanswered-democrats.benghazi.house.gov/cost/" title="http://askedandanswered-democrats.benghazi.house.gov/cost/" target="_blank">http://askedandanswered-democrats.benghazi.house.gov/cost/</a><br/><br/>the only by-product of both kabuki investigations was 2016 alt-right campaign propaganda, a profound weakening of public discourse and a poisoning of the democratic process...effectively, a serious slash mark across the throat of american political civilization.<br/><br/>(and that's not counting the republican's seditious treatment of president obama for eight full years as he was trying to move the country forward)<br/><br/>and now when russia attacks the entire american democracy on american soil and fundamentally interferes with the very foundation of america, "most republicans want to keep the focus on leaks of classified information".<br/><br/>a normal person can't get as unpatriotic and seditious as a congressional republican; they have to work hard everyday at inventing new ways at overthrowing american democracy through deflection, subversion and changing the subject.<br/><br/>who taught these russian congressional republican the meaning of patriotism ? <br/><br/>benedict arnold ?<br/><br/>america was attacked by russia.<br/><br/>and the only thing that porky-pig republicans can muster is a weak stammer and stutter about 'leaks'.<br/><br/>the congressional republican caucus is leaking russian transmission fluid. <S_SEP> whatever the reason for the bromance between putin and trump, the american people will have to make the republicans own it. let them know that if they protect trump, their fate is tied to his. <S_SEP> why should the readers be encouraged to ignore the possible motive that russia/putin has information on trump that involves material of a salacious nature? you explain that i it should be ignored because there's no hard evidence. there's no hard evidence about any theory of what his motive is. it seems, given his history of groping women, given russia's success and predilection of spying on americans-particularly wealthy, powerful americans - that having evidence of his salacious behavior with prostitutes in a moscow hotel is as plausible as any theory involving financial indiscretions. the motive(s) of behavior certainly can involve several and varied embarrassing acts by trump or, as suggested,none, but his absurd admiration of a tyrant. until and unless competent evidence is provided either proving or disproving possible explanations for his inexplicable behavior towards our enemy, we shouldn't ignore any theory or give credence to any. that's what investigations are for. let's hope that, as was the case with watergate, that we are able to get<br/>an honest and thorough investigation by either a bipartisan body or an independent counsel. ag sessions should totally recuse himself for any inquiry. <S_SEP> everything trump does smacks of collusion with the russians. (from trump attacking nato, to dismantling the state department, to changing the republican platform on the ukraine, to not even reacting when russia tested a missile in violation of a long-standing treaty, to not supporting (and trying to undermine) our government's investigation into russia's attack on our election, to trump explicitly asking russians to hack clinton's emails during the campaign, etc....)<br/>trump is a russian dupe. <S_SEP> i feel sure the russians thought hillary would win but i think they thought they would use a defeated trump as "the loyal opposition" to her. probably giving him hacked material he could use from the sidelines - possibly on his own new trump tv network - to hurt hillary, harass and insult her and in general undermine her presidency.<br/><br/>we don't yet know why trump came up with his odious 5 year "birther" campaign against obama but certainly he had been deeply financially involved with russians years prior to that, as had people around him like roger stone - one of trump's closest friends for 30 years.<br/><br/>why isn't it possible the 'birther' campaign, which made no sense to sophisticated people, was actually trash the fsb and putin came up with to tarnish and delegitimize obama's presidency? it never made much sense trump kept that whole thing afloat by himself for years and years - then suddenly abandoned it in september, alongside the wikileaks dumps that were so helpful to him, with no explanation. <br/><br/>it's possible the whole trump campaign carried water for putin all along. trump was toying with starting his own tv network a la fox news after the campaign was over. putin may have thought that would be his opportunity to have an rt channel in this country owned and managed by trump, a putin sympathizer.<br/><br/>all that ended when trump surprised everyone by being elected. <S_SEP> why beat around the bush ... it's obvious that putin won trump the election and expects pay back. it's also obvious that trump isn't forthcoming on what he knows and when he knew it. treasonous malfeasance is not out of the question. <S_SEP> as breathtaking as comey's testimony is, the cessation of republican efforts to shield trump could be even more so. these are politicians, and many of them have already practiced making 180-degree reversals in their positions on donald trump.<br/><br/>yes, trump is now a republican president and not a candidate, but he's making himself a lame duck with a vengeance. his vaunted core of fanatical supporters has never been a decisive political force. those other americans who tentatively put their trust in him and thereby made him president are turning away in droves. neither the mid-term elections nor the next presidential election will be won by trying to sell trumpist moonshine again.<br/><br/>the balance of cold-blooded self-interest will tip, and in a twinkling republicans will go from defending donald trump to being shocked! shocked! at his malfeasance and mental instability.<br/><br/><a href="http://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.jp/" title="http://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.jp/" target="_blank">http://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.jp/</a> <S_SEP> absolutely crucial that trump's us tax return is made public for scrutiny and investigation. it will answer many questions, one way or another. <S_SEP> i always thought it highly suspicious that manafort disappeared from the trump campaign just when news of his russian ties broke. mr. kristof is right to focus attention on manafort, who must be investigated.<br/><br/>there is another disturbing link of trump to russia. he and his family have profited from real estate deals in which wealthy russian oligarchs paid trump tens of millions of dollars more than the properties were worth. money laundering? or, disguised illegal money transfers to trump? either way, trump is hiding his russian connections. <S_SEP> trump is surrounded by russian agent handlers who will assure that he does as putin desires. it may take time. <S_SEP> trump and the russians. really? we had an election. trump won. get over it. <S_SEP> "the republicans who run the senate and the f.b.i. need to pursue their investigations without the friendly deference they have generally shown to trump so far."<br/><br/>of curse that won't happen. republicans are too craven and power-hungry above all else. the truth will emerge, but it will emanate from a "patriotic leaker" or, more likely, a disgruntled former insider. <S_SEP> it seems that money has always been trump's first and best motive. <S_SEP> it would seem apparent that trump's sole interest is the money; please trump it's the money at all costs. i have never seen trump as the successful businessman he keeps telling us he is. more likely a not ready for prime time. <S_SEP> the only way this issue will be accepted by both democrats and republicans is through a non-partisan prosecutorial investigation. citizens have been calling for this for weeks. the longer the republicans stonewall over the issue the more people will believe that they have something to hide themselves. is it possible that a trump investigation could lead to others in the government not here-to-fore mentioned? <S_SEP> donald trump actually managed to hit one nugget of truth in his inane tweets: tha our election process is "sacred." unfortunately, that reference was used in a lie that president obama had interfered by tapping trump.<br/>our democratic process is what gives our government its inherent integrity. but now, signs point to interference from a foreign nation. and we have a right to know the full extent of russia's meddling and what designs putin has for trump holding the white house. this will be a collaborative task.<br/>comey and other intelligence officers, please do not be intimidated by trump calling you out of nazi germany or otherwise disparaging you. you keep his power in check and work independently of the president.<br/>members of the mainstream media, please do not be cowed by trump calling you "failing," "fake news" or snubbing you from press conferences. you will long outlast him.<br/>members of congress, please do not be distracted by trump's stunts, like asking for an investigation of his fabrications, or too fearful of the political fallout from angering trump. you were elected to work for us.<br/>something "very sacred" has indeed been desecrated - by a sitting president and a foreign influence. keeping the nation as we know it means getting to the bottom of this. <S_SEP> this is irresponsible to keep putting out the 'trump russian conspiracy theory'. there are loads of fbi, cia and intelligence operatives who loathe trump, yet they have come up with...nothing, nada, rien.<br/><br/>i was not a trump supporter but i accept him as our president. the truth is, the media and the liberal left cannot accept that hillary clinton lost. yes, that's right...millions of people were so repulsed by her corruption and sense of entitlement that they held their nose and voted for a flawed, twitter-addicted candidate.<br/><br/>that's the thing the left and the liberal media just can't get past. it's been four months since the election. grow up and get over yourselves, please! attacking trump at every turn and wanting him to fail is simply bad for our country. <S_SEP> trump is general bullmoose from lil abner. <S_SEP> living in north carolina, the home of the legendary us senator sam irvin, it breaks my heart that senator burr is in the position to step up and be a gop hero in this frightful scenario. we badly need one of those in powerful positions to demand an independent investigation. yet, burr has chosen to put short-term party gains over rejecting russian interference and possible traitorous actions. former us senator howard baker, gop, showed during the watergate hearings how to stand up to corruption and thievery in your own party. senator burr, have you no shame?? <S_SEP> considering what trump will brag about,one wonders what's in his taxes. the fact that he is suddenly quiet when he normally can't stop bragging makes me curious <S_SEP> as long as we haven't seen donald trump's tax returns, we can speculate on any alliance we want. while mr leonhardt raises the idea trump has financial debts for which he owes or owed solvency to russian lenders, resulting in trump's bizarre and crazy references about russia, ukraine and putin, let's keep it local! try new york! foxnews! it's so much a part of trump's financial, intellectual and emotional life he dissed sweden because he heard ami horowitz on tucker carlson, foxnewstv!<br/>i suggest trump has provided ample evidence that he has a huge stake in foxnews. he routinely and with vehemence names rupert murdoch's competitors, like the times and cnn, as corrupt purveyors of fakery. we've heard the wsj maintains an independent editorial board - why doesn't trump include it in his rants? it's obvious. ivanka trump was a trustee of murdoch's children's huge trust. nearly every day trump is shilling for foxnews by dissing the new york times and cnn. if this isn't a sign of a self-interested and self-dealing shareholder, what else could it be? in addition to a "russia motive," there's plenty of data supporting a "foxnews" motive. <S_SEP> it's safe to assume that whatever happened, the russians - the way smarter negotiating partner in the transaction - assuredly played the trumps without the trumps even knowing it. <S_SEP> how about dealing this the trump way? just make a statement that he has, in fact, colluded with russia and then let him try to disprove it, starting with his tax returns. <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair the desperate efforts by republicans yesterday to protect a proven pathological liar who has shown again and again that he is unable to control his compulsive recklessness, and thus is demonstrably unfit to be president, was inexcusable.<br/>the fact that trump tweeted a lie about the statements being made by the top law enforcers of the fbi and the nsa to his constituents during the hearings, and was corrected in real time at the hearings by both, did not faze the republicans.<br/>they soldiered on by pretending that the leaks to journalists was the real threat to american security, not the interference of a foreign country in our elections, and the possibility that the now president of the country and his closest advisers might have colluded in it. revealed how blindly entrenched they were in putting party over country.<br/>they were tone deaf to the mood in the country to know the truth about russia. instead. like hapless lemmings, they were following their leader right over a cliff. <S_SEP> the thing to remember is that trump never actually planned to become president. the russians on the other hand had other ideas. as has been noted many times tump's businesses were on the brink of implosion. he has been unable to get financing through normal channels for some time now. in stepped the russians with their plan to capture the presidency. originally only planning to disrupt the elections, trump provided them with an opportunity to have a major influence over president. so they provided financial assistance to save his business empire, and influenced the election in favor of trump. they caught lucky break when comey played into their hands with his last minute trashing of hrcs campaign. of course this is all conjecture, but far less so then any of the delusional outbursts coming from trump. even if we get a look at his tax returns, we may not get the whole story because the really bad stuff wont be there. but it would be a start in the right direction. <S_SEP> independent investigation. congress won't do it. <S_SEP> "the top priority now must be to ensure that the f.b.i.’s investigation, which could result in criminal prosecutions, is shielded from meddling by the trump administration...". you mean like when bill clinton met with the us attorney general and she then shut down the investigation of hilary's email improprieties? <S_SEP> trump wants out. <S_SEP> which investigating committee can subpoena trump's tax returns and how soon can this be done? <S_SEP> the gop had how many investigations into clinton? <br/><br/>get a special prosecutor.<br/>we have to have clean elections. <S_SEP> how could this author not mention secretary of state rex "good boy!" tillerman and exxon-mobil's 500 billion dollar deal in russia, currently on hold due to sanctions? former business executives frequently get offered ambassadorships, but an sos with no experience in foreign affairs is unprecedented.<br/>since a whole bunch of experienced journalists can't (yet) get to the bottom of 45's business entanglements and tax returns, how does the irs handle these situations? do they assign dozens of agents to meticulously go over every submitted tax form? since trump has been lying pathologically since forever, what's to prevent him from submitting falsified tax forms? how would the irs know if he omitted ventures in russia? do they have spies fluent in putinese?<br/>rumors are donald gets a 20% stake in the russian-exxon deal when it goes through. <S_SEP> is manifort living and working at trump tower? for how long has this been going on? <S_SEP> there is another possible explanation. trump may be trying to play "good cop/bad cop" with him playing nice to putin while the rest of his administration is much tougher. this may be giving trump too much credit for sophisticated thinking, but sometimes it pays to be underestimated. if putin thinks trump is a fool, he will convince himself that he can get the better of him in any agreements. trump can play off of congress and blame them for not going along with trump's leniency to putin as a negotiating tactic. i doubt that this will work well, but trump fancies himself a brilliant negotiator so maybe he thinks he can pull this off. <S_SEP> perhaps instead of leakers, they should be called whistleblowers since the republicans and trump are trying to bury/hide/obfuscate the truth. <S_SEP> great article. examining the individual dots, there’s a compelling pattern. a strong pattern. yes, we need a full investigation. <br/><br/>trump is not afraid of using innuendo, rumor, and outright dishonesty to get attention. he got launched politically by claiming obama didn’t have a us birth certificate. he knew that wasn’t true. but that outrageous claim launched him on fox news and the pre-campaign trail. trump realizes that spectacle generates headlines and tv coverage. it doesn’t matter if it’s true. the more times the media repeats it, the more real it becomes. that can be useful to divert attention away from something like sessions’ contact with the russians. <br/><br/>lakoff wrote a great post 2 days ago. <a href="https://georgelakoff.com/blog/" title="https://georgelakoff.com/blog/" target="_blank">https://georgelakoff.com/blog/</a> he outlines how the trump’s diversions work. and how the more times a something gets repeated, the more accepted it becomes. <S_SEP> why are leaks about trump's campaign, which occurred prior to him becoming president, even considered "classified"? <S_SEP> it used to be that americans could say, 'politician x may be a crook, but at least he's our crook.' <br/><br/>with trump, we don't even have that solace. <S_SEP> any way to get julian assange to release those trump videos? <S_SEP> here's another dot, and it should be written yuge : money laundering. all that russian organized crime money that has been invested in trump properties, with probable knowledge by the trumps of its source. you can bet there are clues to that in the tax returns. there are oligarchs, both foreign and domestic, to protect from indictment in the us. <S_SEP> this line struck me as hilarious, "if mr. trump’s assertion that there was no collusion between his campaign officials and the russian government is true, he should want this matter to be fully investigated as quickly and as transparently as possible."<br/><br/>now please, you just admitted that trump's administration lies brazenly and constantly. trump's assertion that there was no collusion is obviously untrue, because he said it. also because he wouldn't be fighting this so hard, continuously, to the detriment of all his other policy goals, if there wasn't something to it.<br/><br/>so indeed we're going to have to fight hard to get this investigation done, because the most likely thing is that there was collusion between trump and putin to subvert the election, thus trump is a traitor, thus our "president" is guilty of treason. the penalty for treason, the traditional one, should be applied, and the day it is will be the happiest day of my life. <S_SEP> not this time-it was putin's way of adding $ 55 m to trump-this theft of our election in works for a long time. trump owes 100s of billions to russians. <S_SEP> , russia and trump affair, ukraine's manuevering of opponents mr. kristoff,<br/><br/>thank you for an excellent summary of what we know, what we don't know and what some people suspect may have happened.<br/><br/>like you i don't believe "that there wasn’t a clear-cut quid pro quo between trump and putin to cooperate in stealing the election, but rather something more ambiguous and less transactional..."<br/><br/>taking into account that the unexplained communications between the trump organization and russia's alf bank may be spam, i have always wondered whether or not trump has business or financial ties to russia that compromise his ability to act independently without undermining his interests, which if they exit, remain hidden in unleased tax returns.<br/><br/>one should be wary when considering the steele dossier, however, given the russian government's long record of manuvering opponents into compromising situations and trump's past behavior one cannot simply dismiss the dossier as being pruient non-sense. should be viewed <S_SEP> trump sometimes seems unhinged? <S_SEP> the problem has been that the gop-led house has voted down a bill that would force trump's taxes. they know that they will likely find something illegal and don't want to take the chance of trump's public supporters turning on him and the rest of the party. <S_SEP> your headline here should have read:<br/>special prosecuter required to stop trump and sessions<br/>meddling. <S_SEP> the factor that primarily motivates donald trump is quite obvious: to be seen as yugely successful----at any cost, regardless of actual income / assets.<br/>it is long past time to examine donald trumps tax returns and understand exactly how russia relates to the past 20 years of trump's public and business life. <S_SEP> another fake journalist.... 0% of evidence and 100% insinuation. trump would be proud. keep it up! <S_SEP> trump places loyalty above all else, but when he knows you're a toxic investigation waiting to happen expect to be cut loose; like manafort and flynn. the mindlessly partisan effort masquerading as an investigation doesn't seem interested in them, nor trump's taxes. just saying ... <S_SEP> trump has put his own gain over national security....he needs to go. <S_SEP> why is it that it felt that the republican's on the intelligence committee were more interested in shifting any blame or responsibility from donald trump and his campaign to president obama and his administration being responsible for leaks. <br/><br/>when you listen to the likes of trey gowdy, the guy would wanted to spend his career in the house investigating hillary clinton on benghazi, even though umpteen bipartisan committees had previously found her guilty of no wrong doing, gowdy didn't seem interested at all in the fact that donald trump's tweets and accusations of wire tapping by president obama were lies, gowdy and the other republican's didn't seem to be as concerned that the trump campaign had been contacting the russian's throughout the campaign and with the intent on insuring that hillary clinton lose the election.........it's like the republican's aren't concerned with the truth, as much as shifting blame away from trump.<br/><br/>the republican's on that committee didn't' cover themselves in glory yesterday, trey proved they are partisan and shameless in their lack of any integrity. <S_SEP> follow the money. trump was dead broke not too many years back. the us banks wouldn't go near him. where did the millions come from to reboot his corporation? that putin supported trump in the election because of hatred for hillary clinton is another red herring. it was all about money and power. trump probably owes russia millions and he could pay it back by ignoring russia's aggression in ukraine and their desire to drill in the arctic. <S_SEP> why are we encouraged to ignore the fourth possibility, the only one with actual hard evidence put forth to date? <S_SEP> a special prosecutor would try to build a criminal case - which is very narrowly defined. however, if there was/is collaboration with the russians, we need trump out of the white house because he and his klan pose a national security risk whether or not any easily defined laws were broken. ideally an independent commission with subpoena power comprised of former congressmen and intelligence officers would be formed by congress. but given the current political environment, this is a long shot. a politically expedient compromise would be an independent select committee with subpoena power comprised of current members of congress. this committee would be provided with resources including staff and funding. if trump is impeached, then criminal proceedings against him and his cronies could then commence. the fbi &amp; nsa and other agencies urgently need an independent forum to be able to dump everything they know. a fragmented investigation spread across many standing committees, such as today's partisan house intelligence committee, will never work. only an independent select committee or commission provide the vehicle to properly investigate the russian espionage and collusion. i should think that all americans, no matter where you stand on this issue would want to get to the bottom of this. that is why whatever your belief, all americans need to contact their congressmen and demand an immediate independent select committee or commission. <S_SEP> i see trump's russophilia as something more banal.<br/><br/>putin is trump's daddy figure. the deeply self-loathing donald trump sees in putin his unforgiving and critical father whom donald could never please. so trump projects his self-loathing onto america, the world and his "enemies" with his delusionally apocalyptic pronouncements in the desperate hope that daddy putin will notice, become compassionate in the way that fred trump never could and all will be forgiven. <br/><br/>of course that will never happen so all trump can do to express his repressed rage is to continue to seek revenge, destroy things and toady up to putin.<br/><br/>to sum up, the man needs serious, intensive psychotherapy before he wrecks everything. <S_SEP> an even more salient question is whether the russians colluded with the trump campaign to hack into enough voting machines to tip the electoral college in trump's favor. entirely plausible, considering that trump has gone out of his way during his career to build ties with organized crime. <br/><br/>remember that trump boasted during the campaign that he could shoot someone on fifth avenue, and his numbers would go up. treason, though, may yet be his downfall. <S_SEP> newest report is that trump's intervention to change one gop plank -which he did- was one quid pro quo <S_SEP> i think it is much simpler. putin is an authoritarian and politically incorrect. trump likes both. <S_SEP> many have tried to "normalize" trump's occupation of the white house; legitimize him by pointing out that he "won" the election (if not the votes).<br/><br/>while trump denies reality, we must face it: trump is a cancer on our democracy. he must be removed. republicans will not do their sworn oaths to protect our country. they must be punished. we can do that in 2018, but we cannot wait to remove trump. <br/><br/>we need "patriotic leakers, and journalists, to make sure the truth comes out." we also need brave employees in the irs, cia, fbi, nsa to share with journalists and the nation any and all information that will bring trump down. <S_SEP> name one hacked email that changed votes to trump. <S_SEP> certainly things are getting too hot, and trump is going nuts. <S_SEP> well summarised. i think now trump is done!! <S_SEP> the d's must retake the house in 2018 and investigate trump into oblivion if he hasn't destroyed the country by then. <S_SEP> i agree that its not likely trump and putin met in a dark alley and agreed to steal the election so trump would do putin's bidding.<br/><br/>my guess is it started with small things. russian representatives (overt or covert) offered trump's campaign oppo research on hillary (whom they expected to win, but wanted wounded), perhaps talking points about foreign policy matters useful to russia, so the campaign would sound sophisticated, a heads up on russian policy moves so the campaign would be prepared, and then maybe some give and take on sanctions, and what trump would need to lift them. ultimately, maybe some money.<br/>in exchange, trump would not make russian the demon in foreign affairs that his campaign would focus on, perhaps some loose understanding that sanctions would go away sooner rather than later. he probably thought in all sincerity, there is nothing here untoward. "they hate hillary, so do i." "i'm not revealing state secrets" "if putin admires me, others will too" <S_SEP> mark crozier said: "[trump]... has been conscripted by big oil" agreed. in 2011, exxon and rosneft signed an agreement to exploit siberian oil, possibly worth half a trillion dollars. they need the sanctions lifted and the price of oil supported. trump can help do both. the gratitude from exxon alone could be worth many millions to the trump family. exxon can just steer business their way, no formal payments need be made. likewise, by restarting keystone xl, trump has earned the gratitude of the koch brothers, who can make sure he gets their future business. so, i think the trump-putin connection may be as simple as a marriage officiated by the reverend exxon. a good read on this stuff: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-putin-exxon-what-is-russiagate-really-about_us_58ab1473e4b0fa149f9ac902?jw18iazblnjao47vi&amp;"

target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-putin-exxon-what-is-russiagate...</a> <S_SEP> we need to be clear headed with a laser focus on trump's business ties to russia and subsequent communication. like the bad guy in every movie chase who throws impediments behind him as he's chased in the final scene, rump is a master at diversionary tactics and manipulation. we also must concentrate on the gop, whose larger dysfunction led to trump's ascent. a major party in the united states has become so weak, corrupted, and bereft of ideas that it allowed this unqualified in every way individual to head the gop ticket because they put party loyalty and desire for power over the welfare of the country. the republican party needs to be unmasked for what it is: a danger to democracy for all citizens. <S_SEP> with regard to your 2nd explanation, the business "conspiracy"- not sure what you mean by conspiracy here. jr's remark has been mentioned many times, but how does that jibe with t's oft-repeated (as recently as last week) that he has absolutely no business ties, interests or connections in russia--despite the fact that he visited numerous times (&amp; would he do it for nothing? i don't think so!). so there's a contradiction there. interesting though that he isn't nearly as vocal in his toadying with other iffy countries in which he clearly has large investments--turkey, philippines, etc.<br/><br/>which brings me to the 4th explanation, which you dismiss. that dossier has not been disproven. that of course is a logical fallacy but parts of it have indeed been supported, and it offers the only really strong explanation--that trump is being blackmailed. <S_SEP> we have time. <br/><br/>and it would be the best use of time for trump to actually be under oath instead of going to his bizarre look at me not that rallies. <S_SEP> you would have to be a complete moron to not believe that donald trump's team, with his knowledge, communicated with russian intelligence about manipulating the results of our presidential election.<br/><br/>the most troubling thing about this is that the republican party, for their own selfish reasons, keep supporting him and covering up for him in order to further their agenda. they seem to care less about this country then they do about their political careers.<br/><br/>i just read the american health care bill. it is nothing but a tax reform bill that helps the rich at the expense of the poor. it has 6 pages of instructions for how to screw another poor person who might have luckily won the lottery, a government-sponsored way to tax the poor. it also has instructions for dis-allowing tax credits for anyone who mistakenly buys an insurance plan that allows abortion.<br/><br/>bad<br/>sad <S_SEP> the current situation with trump is troubling on so many levels but not least of which is the fact that trump backed into a corner is his most dangerous. <br/><br/>hopefully the chinese are explaining to north korea to tone things down because trump would love nothing more than a war right now to distract americans from the ongoing trump-russia investigations. <S_SEP> how is colluding with a foreign government, russia, not.....treason?! how?! can you imagine the outrage from the republicans if this were the obama administrations campaign?!! <br/><br/>there is a mountain of evidence, and more, if you add the dossier compiled by the retired mi-6 spy on behalf of a group of republicans prior to the election.<br/><br/>who will have the courage and the integrity on the gop side, to insist on an independent investigation?! who?! anyone, republicans? or is it always party before country?! <S_SEP> unconvincing. if that's all that there is on trump, it's safe to say that he's but a victim of a mccarthian witchhunt. <S_SEP> the republican party: quislings, collaborators and co-conspirators. they all have to go. <S_SEP> the big thing missing from this and similar stories is the money. trump is motivated by two things - fame/spectacle and money. we need to know who is financing his enterprises and deals. the book red notice lays out the role of putin and his cronies in stealing the russian economy from its rightful owners. team trump, i suspect, is a partner with the oligarchs.<br/>as a wise lobbyist taught me -- follow the money. <S_SEP> the gop are doing their very best to make this go away. it's a wart on their credibility and that of the trump administration. if trump is so "clean" on everything then he ought to release his taxes, by refusing to do so clearly indicates he is hiding something. trump is making himself look like a victim, this from a guy who has an extreme aversion to facts and the truth is another abomination we get to witness. the justice department should point a special prosecutor to remove the shroud off the cover ups.<br/><br/>lastly, while possibly woven into all this intrigues , why is it necessary to give ivanka trump access to classified information. there is something wrong with that picture as it is setting a dangerous precedent. this action just adds to the feelings of suspicion that surround this administration to date. <S_SEP> another thread to follow: trump greatly admires the way putin has taken over russia and made it follow him. he likes the idea of a strongman who rules with strong words and, indeed, is able to lie consistently to his countrymen and get away with it. <br/><br/>possibility #2: many of trump's self named towers are worthless, responsible for paying debts that are greater than the potential market value if they were sold. the only means to keep such an "empire" afloat would be to go public, raising lots of cash, or taking on mountains of debt from people who aren't that concerned with how bad the metrics look. the first option, going public, is off the table because the only time trump ran a public company, it went bankrupt, he got put on an allowance and eventually fired. trump never again went public until he decided to run for president.<br/><br/>the idea that trump is buried in debt is a likely one. that's the way he operated all of his business life. he promised much more than could ever be realized, took on debt almost beyond imagining and, shark like, kept churning on to the next deal...the next deal...the next deal. <br/><br/>in recent times, trump abandoned the debt/build game in favor of renting out his name, taking a huge payment up front and a payout over years. risk free money! yes, until you consider that trump university cost him $25 million in hush money to make it go away.<br/><br/>the possibility is very real that russians own trump's backside. they own the rug on which his empire stands. <S_SEP> , russia and trump, russia and ukraine affair, ukraine affair, ukraine and ukraine affair, ukraine and russia affair one important point you failed to make, that has been widely reported, is that at the republican national convention two members of the trump campaign, j.d. gordon and carter page met with the russian ambassador. page also gave a speech criticizing american foreign policy and sanctions against russia. is it just a coincidence that after this meeting the trump campaign gutted the gops strong stance against russia regarding the ukraine? the dots will eventually be connected to a quid pro quo between trump's campaign and the russians. people will eventually be indicted and go to jail. the president will be forced to resign or be impeached. i can think of nothing worse than a presidential candidate colluding, or being willfully blind to collusion within his campaign, with a state adversary in the hopes of winning an election. if this doesn't fit treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors i do not know what would. every action taken by the president since he has been in office with respect to his treatment of russia has only further tightened the distance between the dots. just think about this for a moment ... while the president continues to speak highly of the russians and putin he has essentially treated the press (except for fox and breitbart), the intelligence community and the former president as enemies. something is seriously wrong with this picture. <S_SEP> , russian money laundering it matters very much if trump exchanged favors with russia ,mainly because they are an adversary and because the us has various sanctions on them. also, it is quite possible that trump has allowed his companies to be used for russian money laundering, and releasing his taxes will open the floodgates to federal investigations. <S_SEP> they are worried what trump will out on them if they take a stand against him. and if trump is gone republicans will have no one to blame for their hateful and corrupt legislation against the american people they want to pass. <S_SEP> the unabashed propaganda of the times and other media against trump is counterproductive and will end up in an unexpected solid support for trump. why ? because trump devotees do not read the medias like times. medias reacted by turning simplistic, hoping to reach the simple at heart... they do not; they merely distress people like me who cannot stand for obvious bias and your new unwelcomed approach of dishonesty in reporting... compared to the evil which now looms of total corruption of the medias, trump appears as tle lesser evil.... sad.<br/><br/>pierre jc allard <S_SEP> we know trump can't do his job.<br/>but the republicans won't do their job. <S_SEP> sure, but that doesn't get the trump campaign off the hook. <S_SEP> in the 1990's republicans in congress spent over 40 million dollars on special prosecutor ken starr's investigation of bill clinton, finally hitting pay dirt by exposing clinton's perjury regarding a sexual affair. great political hay was made of it, and the house voted to impeach.<br/><br/>surely even the most partisan of republicans can agree that interference by our long term adversary russia in our our electoral process, in any manner, no matter the reasons, persons or political parties involved, deserves no less scrutiny. <S_SEP> trump is gutting the state department. is he doing putin's bidding? <S_SEP> you're joking, right? trump is so corrupt it ain't even a laughing matter.<br/>anyone who sees him as "clean" for one: didn't know him as we new yorkers knew him from the 80s and two must not be clean themselves <S_SEP> nothing startling about trump's brazen interference.<br/><br/>he's been doing that since day one.<br/><br/>i am really really tired of trump. <S_SEP> it is hard for me to imagine that there could ever be<br/>an independent anything when it comes to donald trump. <S_SEP> , ukraine pro-nato hmm. a few days ago masha gessen published an article in which she suggested there might be little to the russian accusations. she warned against making a big deal out of meeting with an ambassador and she pointed out that when the trump team had the section about lethal aid to ukraine removed from the republican party platform, this was actually in keeping with current policy. obama had not authorized lethal aid either. she urges us instead to focus on the legislation trump and congress are trying to enact now. the problem is trump and company continue to behave in such suspicious way that it's unsettling. i agree with mr. kristof that we need answers. i for one will probably never be capable of trusting trump and his administration until he releases his tax returns. otherwise i will continue to be nagged by the sense that he is hiding something. <S_SEP> , russia and nato all the news makes sense if you draw the conclusion that in fact trump's people with the approval of trump sabotaged the election. this is a man who publicly asked for the russians to hack hillary.<br/><br/>i don't know how he will do it, but i doubt trump will allow a free independent investigation. he knows he is guilty, and has nothing to lose by blocking the investigation. he will just attack the fbi, and keep lying as long as he can.<br/><br/>the news today falls into place. his secretary of state is skipping a nato meeting and visiting russian instead. trump has been openly hostile to our best relationships in europe, germany and england. it's not hard to draw the conclusion that what russia wanted was a president friendly to them, while meanwhile undermining nato.<br/><br/>it is not unimaginable that russia could invade ukraine, and despite nato's commitment to protect every country in it, that trump will refuse to help, claiming there are a lot of deadbeats in nato are not paying a fair share. <S_SEP> to use a baseball analogy: trump wan't ready for the big leagues. <S_SEP> the congress needs to form a bipartisan dedicated special committee to investigate trump's foreign business interests. that committee needs to subpoena his most recent ten years of tax returns and thoroughly analyze them. donald trump is harming this nation more every day. <S_SEP> conspiracy theories constructed from whole cloth fueled by progressive fantasy. <br/><br/>this is junk journalism. there is no evidence suggesting anything untoward. yes, russia is a country. the us is a country. countries sometimes form alliances. well, i think that proves it. <br/><br/>this is why trump says that journalism is the enemy of the american public. you are making up possible facts to support a fanciful narrative, yet you present them as possibly real and speculate on what they might mean. <br/><br/>there is no evidence that trump is a russophile. for most of his detractors the idea that he might take a fantasy to anything would require too much focus and therefore out of trump's reach. anyone spotted any russian tchotchkes in his office?<br/><br/>the idea that russia hacked the dems to help elect trump sounds plausible on its surface -- except -- the hacking of the dnc occurred in summer of 2015 before trump had taken the lead in the republican field. and the damage done to the dnc was minimal at worst -- embarrassing to staffers but voters knew who hrc was before the e-mails. <br/><br/>and so what if trump has had business interests in russia -- or if exxon has contracts with russia. it is insulting to trump and tillerson to suggest that prior business relationships would affect their current jobs. and remember, there is a looking history of american corporations working with enemies -- like nazi germany. <br/><br/>no substance, no story. but that won't stop a times propagandist. <S_SEP> the house hearings that began monday highlighted elected republicans at their most base, dodgy and false. transparency is a good thing -- when it signals open government. the transparency we witnessed today is the negative type, where republicans' obvious shuck and jive, deflection and falsehood were paraded for all to see. their cover was unintentionally transparent, and followed the obvious group strategy of shifting the hearings' focus. they wanted us to take our eye off the ball, trump's/republicans' subversion of the presidential election -- in connivance with ex-kgb vladimir putin, dictator of russia, the soviet union's successor state! they assume we're so stupid as to fall for their fake replacement issue: "leaks" of information that brought about hearings on their election subversion in the first place. if republicans weren't this detestable, they would be pitiful. <S_SEP> i suppose it shouldn't, but it continues to confound me that all those trump supporters who were all over secretary clinton for being "dishonest", a "liar", "totally corrupt", and on and on, are so completely unwilling to demand honesty, truth, and transparency from mr trump. especially on an issue as serious as his relationship with, and beholdenness to, russia and putin. especially considering the public statement by his son, the involvement of his staff, his cabinet choices, and his refusal to release his taxes - the one action that would provide truth and clarity, and clear this whole issue up. those same people who jumped on every crazy rumor about secretary clinton as if they were gospel, are now refusing to demand that mr trump be held accountable in light of verified facts. not only refusing to demand it, but actively opposing discovery of the facts. i can understand the republican congress going that route - they've got big dogs in this right - but the apparent deliberate, combative ignorance and hypocrisy of so many of his supporters is just... amazing! <S_SEP> first, we should start referring to the president's "tweets" as "statements" so as not to belittle their significance. he clearly feels himself to be addressing the nation in these statements<br/><br/>when fbi director comey was asked by representative devin nunes (r-cal.) if he was aware of any "evidence" that votes "were changed" because of russian interference, trump's follow-on statement implied that "no evidence" of "electoral interference" was essentially dispositive of no russian influence on the election.<br/><br/>no, the answer was very much not dispositive. no one will ever find "evidence" of what might have caused voters to "change" their vote, because you do not "change" a vote; voting is a closed event. you cannot change it.<br/><br/>the question is what factors *influenced* voters to vote as they did, and for that, there can never be dispositive evidence. russian manipulation of fake news very well may have had an enormous role. the "evidence-of-votes-changing" question was a perfect red herring from rep. nunes (r-cal.), a distraction, a whiffle ball lovingly placed on a little league t-stand for the child president to swing at. <S_SEP> there are many dots and many more to come. connecting them will be facilitated by remembering one thing: with trump, it's all about the money. <S_SEP> it seems predictable that reporting on mr. trump's lies, and there are some, would be offered as gravely dangerous while all the lies mr. obama issued were never mentioned; at least as lies. he lied in the face of video evidence to the contrary.<br/>he lied to sell his health insurance plan which is now disintegrating before our eyes.<br/>it's very clear no one in the d.c. establishment will tolerate mr. trump. including rooted republicans in congress. he is not a politician and just will not conform to the status quo. his objectives clearly rock the boat "big league".<br/>his election caught democrats completely off guard and their objective is to remove him some how; resignation, impeachment, whatever. they really don't care about the ramifications, they just want him forcibly removed.<br/>it appears the russian election "hacking" fantasy is the choice currently. that has been investigated for almost one year with no evidence found. even mr. obama said it was not possible, and he is correct, to manipulate votes. that would take entering voting machines or databases if they were online. the russians would have to know what precincts to manipulate of the thousands and be able to predict the outcome of the electoral college all within a 12 hour period.<br/>however what seems to be true is they entered hillary's illegal, unprotected email server and the unprotected dnc email server and copied emails.<br/>the contents of which have never been denied. impossible to know the impact of that. <S_SEP> if republicans in congress won't appoint a special prosecutor, what can we do?<br/>all of us, the new york times, anybody? and, as i think sen. paul said recently "republicans investigating republicans is a waste of time." <S_SEP> all you have asked for will happen within trumps first term but will you like the results as the ones convicted will be those associated with the last administration? <S_SEP> nicholas kristoff's points #5 and #6 certainly seem to explain trump's disinterest in putin's invasion of ukraine, though trump has never shown any kind of a worldview on anything other than where his next hotel and golf course will go. he is as unworldly and unsophisticated and disinterested as are his followers.<br/><br/>trump is brilliant, however. he made up the nonsense of president obama "wiretapping" his campaign offices to get the still-unwitting press to back off exploring a trump-putin connection. brilliant strategy. <S_SEP> get real. enough diversion from the real issue. <S_SEP> love the way you summed up all the key issues succinctly. these are scary times for those who value democracy and transparency. <S_SEP> , obama, trump's campaign, russia and election trump sets-up a dis-information narrative and then plays it to the hilt; even from day one, 2015. he talked a bigoted campaign and then charged hilary with bigotry. <br/><br/>trump is colluding with russia and just after asking russia to find hillary's emails, he charges hillary with talking to the russians. <br/><br/>trump inured himself with his foundation monies and then he charges hillary with benefiting from her foundation. <br/><br/>trump's campaign is rigging the election with russia while the gop is rigging the voting system, then trump claims that hillary &amp; party are rigging the election. <br/><br/>the media start calling trump on his lies and false claims and he calls the media dishonest and liars. <br/><br/>data about trump's campaign staff's relationship with russia is leaked and then trump calls the intelligence community liars, claims we need to stop everything and start looking for those whistle blowers. <br/><br/>and when push comes to shove, he charges obama with wire tapping his offices and demands that it needs to be investigated immediately. now that is interesting!<br/><br/>does trump want to illegally use wire tapping against his enemies? <S_SEP> dear mr.kristof,<br/> i don’t believe that anyone with an open mind doubts for a minute that there was and is collusion between trump &amp; russia, &amp; that russia did what ever they could to put trump in office. the problem is, that as long as there is hope among the largest voting block in the country the non college white working person who put trump in the white house, that trump will give them high paying jobs, they will continue to support him.should he falter in any way, his house of cards will come tumbling down.it’s very early in his administration, and so far aside from his tweets, &amp; innuendoes, he has not accomplished anything .his one incursion into yemen was a disaster.the country is more divided than ever, &amp; hatred is running rampant.he doesn’t have to show his tax returns, the mere fact, that he won’t, is reason enough for the people to feel he’s hiding something.if there is not a boom in jobs &amp; the economy, by the mid term elections, the blue collar workers will not come out to vote, &amp; trump will lose his mandate, &amp; spend his last two years as a lame duck &amp; a failure. <S_SEP> wikileaks promised to leak the tax returns....<br/>but they have not<br/>did they receive them?<br/>false information or none-existant or covering for trump/putin?<br/>what does mr. chris steele say, now that he has emerged from hiding? <S_SEP> rep. schiff laid out a coherent story. <br/><br/>ps. no one is suggesting that russians interfered with actual vote tallies.<br/><br/>don't you find it interesting that only information about internal democratic workings was leaked? <S_SEP> first of all, there is no certainty that comey will handle this correctly, as the editorial seems to assume. his past performance is a predictor of future performance. obviously, he couldn't squash the investigation this soon. he can, however, do many things to have it turn out as the republicans want.<br/><br/>secondly, trump will simply lie and toss, whomever, to the sharks and say he knew nothing of what his minion was doing. so unless they have trump himself recorded talking to the russians, nothing will change. if they do have trump talking to the russians and didn't say anything about it, then it's a coverup by the republicans.<br/><br/>no matter which way this goes, the united states loses. beautiful. thanks mr. trump. <S_SEP> , russia and u.s. government too many conflicts of interest now:<br/><br/>mcconnell's wife on trump's cabinet, nunes on the transition team, sessions as one of trump's earliest supporters and one who had russian contacts himself that he lied about under oath, kellyanne's husband in the justice department, all those political commissars that trump has spying on different departments now, the constant threats against whistleblowers and attempts to intimidate them, trump's firings of people like the acting attorney general who said his muslim ban might be unconstitutional (as several judges have also now said) and of the new york prosecutor who was investigating one of trump's people -- all of these represent clear conflicts of interest and political suppression of justice. <br/><br/>only an independent prosecutor has any chance of finding out what went on and how much collusion there was. the intelligence agencies expect russia to interfere even more in the future since it worked this time. this is all treason. <S_SEP> great column as usual mr kristof.<br/><br/>"the way to ease these suspicions would be to examine trump’s tax returns: any government investigation that doesn’t obtain trump’s tax returns simply isn’t a thorough investigation."<br/><br/>that is the key to this whole russian affair, so-called president trump's tax returns. releasing would prove he is innocent and not a corrupt dupe of vladimir putin and the fsb.<br/><br/>but for some reason he does not want to release his tax returns willingly. i wonder why? <br/><br/>it is possible that there are no links to the russians, maybe he just does not want us to find out that is is really not a billionaire? or maybe that his operation is some sort of ponzi scheme? or maybe both?<br/><br/>but definitely not russia. after all, didn't "the donald" say "no puppet, no puppet" during the debates? how much more proof do you enemies of the people need?<br/><br/>as you can see i am more than willing to give so-called president trump the benefit of the doubt.<br/><br/>==<br/><br/>think of the children: <br/><br/><a href="https://userctl.com/bluevsred/058.png" title="https://userctl.com/bluevsred/058.png" target="_blank">https://userctl.com/bluevsred/058.png</a> <S_SEP> excellent summation. now all we need is for an independent counsel to look at it all so that trump can be impeached, before too much irreversible damage is done to our country! <S_SEP> clearly trump has something to hide or he wouldn't be making all this noise and tweeting more than a hungry baby bird <S_SEP> treasonous trump may simply view putin as a great role model....<br/><br/>has muzzled the press through effective intimidation -- check.<br/><br/>uses the power of the state to loot national resources to benefit cronies. -- check.<br/><br/>uses the power to the state to keep cronies in line -- check.<br/><br/>uses a captive court system to seize property from and imprison opponents. -- check.<br/><br/>uses state intelligence services to assassinate opponents who are outside the country. -- check.<br/><br/>sounds like a laundry list of what the donald would like to do, doesn't it? <S_SEP> here's the story of trump full throttle.<br/>first some will hate 'im.<br/>then a lot'll.<br/><br/>apologies to ogden nash <S_SEP> there has to be a faction of the gop that would consider going ahead with the inevitable and streamlining trump's demise and trying to get some things done with pence, while they can. <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair, russia and u.s. election what if, as seems far more likely, the investigation reveals that there was collusion between trump and putin to subvert our election, and that trump is therefore guilty of treason? will you stop supporting him then, or will you cling to your belief in his lies? <S_SEP> , partisan politics unfortunate for the country, we are cursed with an unintelligent, unprepared little man playing at being president of the united states. many people, myself included, at various times and in different comments, have gratuitously referred to the little man behind the curtain, as being a liar, which, in my opinion, he clearly is, as well as being mentally unwell, which he well may be. i don't know. i'm not a mental health expert, and do not play one on tv, so i can't say what is the specific mental disorder with which he is cursed. but that mental health disorder may be capable of leading america to rack and ruin. whatever his problem, if this prevaricator wants to help america resolve the question of the authenticity of the last presidential election, and truly wants to put rest the question of russian meddling in our affairs, then he must agree to allow the justice department to appoint an independent special prosecutor. if he does not, then he must be deemed unfit for the office he holds, and somehow legally removed from office. on this issue the time for partisan politics is long past due, as well as on the healthcare bill. i believe the speaker is rushing to try to ram this bill through congress because he knows how unfit the president is, and well knows if there's an independent investigation into russian meddling, the political landscape may well be altered. it is a time for statesmen of both parties to act. are there any in america? <S_SEP> rachel maddow connected another series of dots that was very illuminating. when added to the the context of all the other dots explained in this article, the picture of trump's debt to russians is so clear. <br/><br/>from an article summarizing maddow's episode on this topic: this one involves newly-confirmed commerce secretary wilbur ross.<br/><br/>ross sits at the center of an extremely shady florida real estate deal between donald trump and a billionaire russian fertilizer magnate named dmitry rybolovlev with a need to hide large amounts of money.<br/><br/>said maddow: “at the time this magical deal emerged out of nowhere that put tens of millions of dollars in donald trump’s pocket... trump was financially having a very difficult time. it is a matter of public record that he was fighting very hard among other things to avoid paying off a very big loan that he had with deutsche bank. deutsche bank needs the money that means trump needs the money, that means trump needs to get the money, so… this mysterious infusion of cash from the russian guy came at just the right time for now president trump.”<br/><br/>added maddow: “every investigative reporter in the country right now is trying to figure out whether there is some reason our president appears to feel so beholden to russia, and to vladimir putin. well this part here is not like a loose thread, this is like a rope ladder hanging down from the ceiling begging people to crawl up this and look around.” <S_SEP> what's the motive ? rubles. ( billions upon billions of rubles ) <br/><br/>there is no secret ( except for the tax returns ) as to why this administration is doing what it is and has. it is for the money. <br/><br/>i would say follow it , but we cannot even do that. <S_SEP> how about - the russians were tying to collude with the trump campaign? <S_SEP> trump's animus towards the media reflects the fact that it is the only thing that stands in the way of trump's total corruption. the nyt must stand by its commitment to reveal trump's treachery. and reveal which one or all of these points apply to trump. i personally believe that putin's one humdred billion dollar nest egg is a strong attraction to trump's greed. <S_SEP> republicans know that what they want is neither ethical, nor is it for the best of the country--but they are determined to do it anyway.<br/><br/>they seem more concerned about stopping leaks about russian connections that expose their bad deeds, than getting to the bottom of the bad deeds themselves.<br/><br/>they forced cabinet votes before important info. was known about the candidates.<br/><br/>they subverted the our previous pres. role in hearing his choice as justice.<br/><br/>their healthcare plan will put the health of millions of americans at risk, so they lie and call it "improved."<br/><br/>they are determined to suppress votes, in the name of preventing "cheating."<br/><br/>mcconnel and ryan are especially duplicitous---i have to imagine there are at least a few honorable republicans who are horrified by their colleagues' cruel and underhanded ways that undermine our government and democracy. but maybe there aren't any. <S_SEP> your going to need more dots... how about how the trump campaign got the gop to remove its anti-russia stance from their platform at the convention.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-guts-gops-anti-russia-stance-on-ukraine/2016/07/18/98adb3b0-4cf3-11e6-a7d8-13d06b37f256_story.html" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/trump-campaign-g...</a> <S_SEP> who loans millions to trump after his third bankruptcy?<br/>russians!<br/>the answer is will documented in the last ten years of his tax returns.<br/>go after manchurian trump's tax returns relentlessly just as trump did in pursuit of obama's birth certificate.<br/><br/>(what would republicans have done if obama or hilary had failed to produce theirs but their candidate did?) <S_SEP> connect the dots and circle the wagons. i have another dot, # 11. medical disability rendering trump incapable of fulfilling his official duties. his father was grandiose in his later years and died of dementia at 83. at 70, trump is not too young to have symptoms of dementia, as he probably inherited the genes for that disease. trump is disoriented in time, place and person, as when he confuses 9/11 and 7/11, which are times, places and names. he tweeted that paris is in germany and asked voters to cast their ballots for him on 11/28. trump uses neologisms or made up words such as "bigly" and "asterick." he declined daily security briefings because he did not want to hear the same words repeated to him daily for the next 8 years, meaning that his language and memory functions are severely impaired so he can only recall words and phrases but not context or narratives. trump has a new open door policy. since his memory extends only to writing a 140 character tweet, the constant interrupts will assure that he does not know what's going on. due to memory impairment, i think it's possible that trump did not recognize any of the women who alleged that he had assaulted them sexually. he engages in magical thinking, that he has only to imagine or think something and real changes occur in the world. such thinking is concrete, primitive and infantile. there are enough dots to make a case for measles. <S_SEP> trump is enron. too bad we cannot short him. <S_SEP> just another monday in trump's america. there have been 9 of them so far, can you believe it? <S_SEP> republicans in congress aren't afraid of trump, they're afraid of his core voters. they have a convincing history of severely punishing ("primary-ing") congressmen they consider traitors to the cause. the threat is real. <br/><br/>the gop leadership needs to slowly start convincing trumpsters that their hero is not fulfilling his promises to them. these voters need to see that his antics aren't really meant to upset the establishment; they're designed to cover up his ineptitude. when enough of his base is starts doubting him, trump will loose power and the adults in the gop will be able to step in.<br/><br/>meanwhile, i don't think trump loves the russians. i think he's afraid of them. if he has really borrowed millions from those thugs, he does not want to get sideways with them. unlike lenders in the us, russian oligarchs are not likely to simply roll-over if trump defaults. so he plays nice to keep from being targeted.<br/><br/>speculation: what if trump ran for president not to get power, but to get protection? <S_SEP> i find the most probable contact is eric's statement that money is pouring in. i read recently that putin is a billionaire, having stolen russia blind. he needed to put that money somewhere. i suspect the us is part of a diversified portfolio through out the world. real estate holdings that spread throughout the world, that are maintained and operated by another party is even better. plus trump understands he could suddenly die as many of trumps acquaintances have. <S_SEP> yes, the "republicans who run the senate and the f.b.i. need to pursue their investigations without the friendly deference they have generally shown to trump so far." absolutely!<br/><br/>so far, with the exception of some statements by a few senators such as john mccain, congressional republicans have been shockingly reluctant to do so. rep. jason chaffetz, the current head of the house oversight and government reform committee appears to be totally disinterested in investigating the connections between russia and either trump himself or those who've served either in his new administration or in his 2016 campaign. instead, chaffetz has decided to focus his energies on investigating who leaked the information about former white house national security advisor michael flynn, rather than flynn's questionable contacts with russia's ambassador to the u.s.<br/><br/>whatever the motive or motives are behind trump's embrace of putin and russia, the u.s. has never before had a situation where a candidate and then president has blindly embraced a foreign power to the degree that trump and both his senior campaign and administration staff have embraced russia. <br/><br/>this embrace, combined with the apparent russian involvement in pre-election hacking, should give every american who values our nation's sovereignty, serious cause for concern. the only way to address these is through congressional hearings and fbi investigations. congressional republicans need to do their part and hold hearings now. <S_SEP> i am afraid trump is much more ideological than most of his critics realize. <S_SEP> i'm no conspiracy theorist. there were fundamental political currents that enabled trump to become a viable winner of last year's election. they include the long term effects of income inequality as well as the weakness of the democratic candidate.<br/><br/>it makes sense to me that the russians were able to compromise trump.<br/><br/>the facts are that trump's access to capital isn't nearly as easy as trump would have us believe. why? because he's got a proven track record of screwing lender and contractor alike. big banks remember that stuff.<br/><br/>there may have come a time when he was financially squeezed and needed a loan to bridge him to a time when cash was going to come in. the usual banks refused him for good reason. daddy was dead, and couldn't ride to the rescue. so he started to bottom feed. looking for someone who could help.<br/><br/>that's where he came into contact with a willing russian "bank." a deal got done at reasonably high interest rates. he made it through a difficult period and viola, all was well.<br/><br/>then he needed them again. for whatever reason. in his dealing with them his behavior allowed them to compromise him. now they had him. a willing agent who would do their bidding as required. <br/><br/>he ran for president and they helped. the russians didn't want clinton to win. she knew exactly who putin was. a mafia thug.<br/><br/>that trump won was completely unexpected.<br/><br/>for trump the problem is that there is a russian trail behind him. and the hounds have sniffed it out. <S_SEP> the only thing i really want to read about trump is the announcement of his indictment. <S_SEP> donald trump's baseless, groundless accusations against president barack obama are symptomatic of a deeper psychological and emotional dysfunction that now guides american policy, both foreign and domestic.<br/><br/>before examining trump's fascination with all things russia(n), i think it might be enlightening to focus, first, on his hatred of the black president. whether or not trump actually believed president obama was a kenyan plant in the oval office, he took the half-baked idea out of the wash before it was dry. in all likelihood, he was infected with fringe conspiracy theories along the lines of the wild schemes that make up rush limbaugh's daily tirades. fox news, a cowardly follower, waits for limbaugh to unleash his nonsense before putting out its own version of the swill.<br/><br/>trump had to see what decency, hard work and a noble determination could do for a literally unknown illinois senator. for, make no mistake, when barack obama announced his bid for the presidency, he was viewed as a populist, even, on the right, as a radical.<br/><br/>the trump magnet for vladimir putin was the realtor's astonishing ignorance. how could the russian not fail to see in trump a virtual tabula rasa whom he could use to forge his regressive world view? it says here that paul manafort was a putin plant; after that, the virus attacked the body, much like the flu. the symptoms were everywhere.<br/><br/>trump is too stupid to have done all this on his own. he was cleverly chosen by putin. it's the missing link. <S_SEP> nothing about donald trumps july 2016 invite to break into hillary's emails? <S_SEP> anti-trump activists are facing a crucial moral-historical dilemma: is it morally permitted and historically necessary to use the anti-russian popular attitude in order to topple the seemingly unhinged and anti-democratic president?<br/><br/>by now, the anti-trump camp answer is clear -- use everything which seems to have negative effect on trump and his administration: from questioning his suspicious and murky motives (allegedly leading to collusion with russia during the election and before and after inauguration), to taking part in a twisted anti-russian incitement campaign (“as hostile as putin”), all the way to an intensive crusade against manufactured russian threats and trump’s alleged russia-first doctrine -- led by the misguided crusader-for-global-democracy senator j. mccain and the calculated crusader-for-global-domination senator l. graham – which is liable to start a global confrontation with russia <br/><br/>the anti-trump campaigners (among them, indeed, the best and the brightest) may not like at all the (potentially radioactive) fruits of their moral-historical choice. <S_SEP> step 1. subpoena trump's tax returns. all of them. <S_SEP> comment part 2: btw, trump's taxes could not be viewed, allegedly, due to ongoing irs audit. just when will that audit be completed? would the resident decree "never"? <S_SEP> i think the flurry of trump tweets undermined trump not the fbi. certainly indicates trump is ready to meddle in this investigation and all the more reason for a special prosecutor. collusion with a foreign country on the scale of trump campaign officials is unprecedented. the gun is smokin' hot. <S_SEP> soxared, 04-07-13<br/><br/>one lesson from the old soviet era is the use of multiple cells as checks on each other, as none can be trusted completely. see klaus fuchs and the rosenbergs as an example. so i assert that there isn't just one connection back to putin upon which we can focus.<br/><br/>the primary question for which there have been zero answers is, "why is trump so beholden to russia and putin?" putin is the only world leader who trump has taken pains not to insult. trump has given putin special consideration at every turn, even when unbidden. why? why? why?<br/><br/>we should be very careful reacting to each trump tweet. they are designed to deflect away from a much larger issue. libeling obama was a cheap way to deflect from russia. <br/><br/>also, my neighbor the realtor® cringes when trump is called a realtor. i checked, and trump is not. they take an ethical oath which trump fails 70-80% of his statements. <S_SEP> his son's comments about business connections in russia completely contradict trump's protests that "i have no deals in russia." no deals, but dealings. <br/><br/>lying may be an art to some. but, trump is an easy liar.<br/>to trump, part slick con, part yarn-spinning old porch sitter, it's as natural as breathing. whatever comes out of his mouth is…whatever.<br/>attacks in sweden or 42% unemployment!<br/><br/>want the formula to trump?<br/>listen to his words, then take the exact 180 degrees opposite and that is the truth. (think of john lovitz as "the liar" on snl)<br/><br/>trump university was a great success.<br/>i'm under irs audit.<br/>largest inauguration crowd in history.<br/>my campaign had no ties to russia. <br/><br/>all his careless utterances, all his lies give us the truth.<br/>so, we know all.<br/><br/>just need to trust the formula and act accordingly. <S_SEP> money, follow the money. if we can't get him now we can go after him post presidency. <S_SEP> i have never seen a phrase made with such unbridled cynicism as "the goal must be to make american political parties and democratic institutions less vulnerable to efforts to distort the electoral process..." the idea that congress through a select committee can or would do anything to actually improve what little is left of our democracy is both laughable and tragic.<br/><br/>in the last decade our courts have decimated the voting rights act. both parties have practice gerrymandering with impunity. the senate has become a millionaires club and the 30,000 lobbyists that crawl around the capital have more influence that the voters do. at the state level our representatives don't even write legislation, the corporate lobbying group alec does it for them.<br/><br/>polls like pew trust and gallup regularly verify policies that the majority of people support only to have congress either do the opposite or nothing at all. a recent study by two prominent political scientists concluded that we have become an oligarchy, which is a system more responsive to money than to its citizens.<br/><br/>yet, the major media would have us believe that this degradation of our democracy doesn't really exist, or it pales in the face of russian seeking to "influence our elections" by releasing a hand full of emails that almost no one read.<br/><br/>trump's administration is a cesspool and he deserves to be impeached. but congress is no better. next time have 'none of the above' on the ballot. <S_SEP> i think the gop sold their souls with their support of trump. they knew he would be a disaster but they didn't care because they wanted a republican president. now, it seems like their plan is working. the president is self-destructing before our eyes and pence is waiting in the wings. pence is as scary as trump but in different ways. but the gop leaders know that pence will do what they tell him to do. <S_SEP> trump <br/><br/>think the duke &amp; the king in "huck finn". <S_SEP> , russia and usa relations i commend your editorial, but believe there is little chance that a full independent investigation will be done. the republicans main strategy is to deflect the hearings into looking at leaks instead of how the russians have tried to debase the foundations of our democracy. you have to wonder if all republicans, when taking their oath of office, must have one hand behind their back with fingers crossed. sad, very sad. <S_SEP> pretty funny to read all the comments from deranged libs. no one has provided any evidence at all that trump has done anything illegal. all that's been done is democrats have once again come up with lies because they act like little children because they got destroyed in the election. sorry libs, no one cares about your little tantrums!!! leave trump alone and let him fix all the disasters obama created!!!! <S_SEP> keep in mind, no one was harder on whistleblowers than obama. <S_SEP> i have no doubt that russia owns trump, there are too many signs to be a coincidence. the investigation is to determine how it happened and how to divorce them. but the republicans are complicit, taking advantage of trump. to russia's glee republicans are dismantling the american economy and democracy. russia wins either way - either because trump removes sanctions and makes them great again - or because america's position as a world power is destroyed. and if things continue as they have so far russia achieves both of these goals. republicans have become the enemy. <S_SEP> although all the explanations outlined in the article have some merit and most likely motivate trump to some degree the explanation i am most partial to is the one that explains trump's fervor for russia and putin based on solid business ties between trump and putin. remember first and foremost trump is the businessman, deal maker and profiteer.<br/>in my scenario putin is not only trump's role model from a leadership standpoint---a scary thought in itself---trump is business partners with russian oligarchs including putin and was hired by putin for a cool $1 billion "consulting fee" to win the american election so putin would have a really good friend in the white house. putin is literally trump's boss for money. putin could well afford such an expense with personal wealth estimated at as much as $60 billion. and putin would certainly have the contacts and motive needed to hire trump.<br/>i smell smoke and i see fire. trump the traitor to america for cash? i think that's a real possibility the congress and fbi should actively and thoroughly investigate no matter where it leads. much more of a threat to america's safety and independence than clinton's e mails could ever hope to be. <S_SEP> just as it proved out when giuliani broadly "hinted" that he and the campaign knew of imminent news breaking that would be blockbuster for the hillary campaign the day before the comey letter, that he had inside information from people in the fbi, the "coincidences" of contacts and policies between the campaign and russia points to maybe not collusion but at least agreement on an action/reaction plan. <br/><br/>i still don't believe that people don't recall trump calling for the russians to hack hillary's e-mail just before wikileaks began releasing them - so blatant it's not to be believed? hiding in the open?<br/><br/>i agree that the tax returns are appearing more likely to be a smoking gun. no conclusion of any investigation can have credibility if it has not included the review of those critical documents.<br/><br/>this is serious stuff, not to be brushed aside or minimized as partisan politics by republican leaders. if there is no there there, let's have at it, in the open, in the light, you guys dig harder than anyone, then stand back and crow all you want "see? we told you so!" we'll all be glad, and we can get this behind us and go on to the important stuff like your wreck of a health plan! <S_SEP> no real investigation of the russian connection to trump will occur within the government. the republican controlled congress gains nothing by bringing down trump and potentially loses a lot. fbi director has already thrown his lot with trump too. it will be up to the press. <S_SEP> i would like to see republicans examine the trump - russia ties as closely as they did benghazi in their exhaustive hearings. we deserve no less. <S_SEP> it could be that, facing a certain amount of economic stagnation, both russian corporations and us corporations see easy pickings in the dismemberment of the eu back into two spheres of influence and are pushing their governments in that direction. this would in theory take both companies back to the era when nationalists believe they were 'great'.<br/>the existence of the worlds largest market sitting between the two superpowers, with huge wealth and insufficient defence and political integration, is certainly tempting and is a much easier way for both governments to deliver for their constituencies than the hard graft of creating growth through strategic economic planning. right-wing nationalism is the perfect way to drive wedges into the cracks in an organisation based on voluntary merging of sovereignty.<br/>by it's nature, the destruction of the eu and the division of its spoils would only be a temporary collaboration between the us and russia. once complete, we would be straight back to the very tense situation that reagan believed he had resolved forever. <S_SEP> why wouldn't the republicans in congress be willing to investigate? if they find impeachable offenses, they could dump trump and have pence who would be more to their liking for passing their legislative agenda and returning order to the white house. <S_SEP> , hacked dnc haunting news? please. fbi was looking into the possibility russia hacked dnc &amp; podesta last year. and we know dems have been looking for excuses for getting their tails whipped last nov. russia &amp; trump -- just another excuse. but the fbi had no choice to investigate a possible trump-russia connection given the politics. but regardless of biased headlines &amp; hysteria, facts and logic exist the times can't ignore (though they do) including:<br/><br/>no evidence that:<br/><br/>1) russian gov ordered hacking dems.<br/><br/>2) trump's team colluded with russia.<br/><br/>3) leaked e-mails influenced election.<br/><br/>4) any contacts between trump's team members &amp; russians were unusual - or illegal.<br/><br/>5) russia had any leverage over trump<br/><br/>6) anything pres trump has done has benefited russia<br/><br/>plus:<br/><br/>5) time line makes no sense -- dnc was hacked in 2015 at about the time trump announced &amp; he wasn't front runner.<br/><br/>6) why would russia favor trump? obama attempted to improve relations w/ russia (reset). putin pushed obama around on foreign policy. hrc ok'd sale of our uranium to russia. why switch to traditionally hard line repubs?<br/><br/>8) if russia wanted to influence election, leaked dem emails were weak beer at best. <br/><br/>9) why would trump work with russia to undermine dems? hackers abound. <br/><br/>10) if russia hacked dems to help trump -- why make it obvious they did the hacking? can't have it both ways -- russia are genius hackers, but can't cover their tracks? really? <br/><br/>dream on dems. <S_SEP> , tax cuts, gop i believe it's fueled by opportunism. congressional republicans see this as their opportunity to destroy the aca, medicaid, medicare and social security. provide huge tax cuts to the uber-wealthy and control of women's heath choices to evangelicals and opus dei. <br/><br/>this is their best chance to turn america into a corporate owned theocracy. <S_SEP> we are all living in ignorance until trump's tax returns- especially 2007+- are subpoenaed. if he's making such a big effort to hide them from the american people. they probably contain something revealing. senators, subpoena trump's tax returns!!! <S_SEP> of your five motives you describe, the only one i reject out of hand is the first. trump has no conception of sound public policy, he doesn't care about it, and he didn't run for president so he could implement it. trump is all about trump. so any reasonable explanation for his motives in cozying up to putin must begin there. he's doing it because he thinks it will benefit him personally--either by keeping current creditors or investors happy, or by opening doors for future investment, or by keeping his past indiscretions secret, or by enhancing his power, or in some other way. trump sought the white house for personal gain and not for public good. the most depressing thing of all is that the american people went along with it. <S_SEP> i generally agree with premises two through five (trump will lie his way of the fourth) but am having a hard time with the first. sure, reduced tensions between the russia and the united states would be better, but we can say the same for china which trump is constantly antagonizing. russia and the us have little in the way of common purposes and objectives, especially regarding syria. i think most learned observers in the west would like to see al-assad gone and possibly stand trial for war crimes. putin’s goal all along has been to prevent this from happening and to maintain a strategic presence in the middle east and the eastern mediterranean. supposed collaboration to defeat isis is a red herring. trump hypes isis to keep his evangelical base in the fold and use as a common enemy to restrict immigration and ramp up domestic security. trump has not a care about any humanitarian crises in syria or elsewhere.<br/>so, back to the mantra: congress needs put the trump regime under oath, subpoena his taxes, follow the money, and find out how much in debt our president is to russia. <S_SEP> russiagate must be investigated by a watergate type special prosecutor, now! there is no greater enemy than those who seek to destroy the vote. <S_SEP> , mercer's russian investments thank you for staying focused on this issue, clearly it's caused panic in the trump white house, and russia, and gop, evidenced by bizarre tweets accusing president obama of spying on him in trump tower, his attacks on the press, the fbi - and his refusal to ask his own justice department to confirm that there was no fisa warrant issued for him during the campaign or transition. wikileaks timely release of cia hacked documents this week was equal to that of wikileaks time release of clinton emails - all to help trump. then ryan releases healthcare "replacement" bill, without it having first gone to cbo and without the buy-in of his own party leadership.<br/><br/>when you add in all the contact and meetings between senior trump campaign and white house advisers including his own son-in-law together with flynn during transition, bannon's leninist leanings, and robert mercer's extraordinarily large hedge fund investments in russia, trump org reliance on oligarchs fundings - well, all is not as it should be and we need to know what that is. everyone in the free world knows trump could have released his tax returns to turn back the questions of his ties with russia. he won't for a reason, he can't. <S_SEP> , nsc circumstantial evidences suggest that the fourth explanation is quite plausible and cannot be disregarded:<br/><br/>compromising material does not need to be about trump's "sexapades". the dossier may contain reasons behind trump's steadfast denial to disclose his tax returns. <br/><br/>trump has refused to denounce all of putin's specific actions or positions. he keep denying his team's contacts with russian intelligence even after russian confirmed the same. his defense has been hollow and alarming ... even for republican members of congress and his supporters. <br/><br/>trump is not an ideologue. he also does not have smarts or coherence of thoughts. yet a group of pro-russia advisers and cabinet members was assembled. this points to someone with dominating leverage over trump. <br/><br/>media has reported that trump wasn’t pleased about not knowing the full contents of the executive order that made bannon a permanent member of nsc. the order was authored by bannon. it means that bannon self-appointed himself to nsc. despite such trickery, ever so willing to say "you are fired", trump still has not shown willingness or courage to remove bannon. <br/><br/>nyt reported that russia chose to move forward with its own cruise missiles. trump did not respond to it and managed to circumvent it through thursday’s bizarre press conference. perhaps by design?<br/><br/>too many date points that suggest distinct possibility that both putin and bannon have dossiers on trump, independently or jointly. <S_SEP> the irs employee that leaks trump's tax returns will be a hero <S_SEP> hi,<br/>you seem to be an insightful and intelligent person, yet you also seem to support trump... i am trying to understand trump supporters like yourself. politics, left/right, aside how do those still supporting trump view his lying. i don't think it's possible for a sentient person to deny that trump is liar, he lies about things both big and small, and about things that are easily verified. so how does a trump supporter feel about this? thanks for sharing your thoughts on this. <S_SEP> tax returns! obama provided his birth certificate! let's see trump's tax returns! <S_SEP> well laid out. i think both trump's ties to russia and the clinton money machine should both be thoroughly investigated. in the interest of intellectual honesty, mr.kristof perhaps you can write a bit about the disturbing money from foreign entities the clintons received over the years? thanks. <S_SEP> trump's pro-russia behavior and refusal to disclose his taxes make it apparent he has much to hide. the fact that anyone disputes this connection is laughable. why is this man allowed to get away with murder? why is he allowed to continue using the presidency like just another business? aren't people outraged? yes, they are! but despite such flagrant violations of trust and propriety, trump skips along his merry way. is there no way to force this grifter to show his hand? don't americans deserve more from our president? <S_SEP> let's touch base again after commrade trump resigns in disgrace. <S_SEP> republicans in congress are more interested in upholding their party and the koch brothers' agenda than upholding the constitution. <S_SEP> , russian kleptocracy, money laundering follow the money!!!!!! trump is into the russian kleptocracy big time. check the tax returns for money laundering operations couched as businesses and shell corporations. manafort is a point man. <S_SEP> but trump, to the republicans, represents the best of their brand. his lies are so beautiful, so filled with magical thinking, that voters believe them! republicans have been lying to the voting public for years, just not as well as trump. now they can use him as a vast distraction while they follow their plan of dismantling our democracy in favor of the wealthy who own them. <S_SEP> what makes one fearful is not the republicans willingness to look the other way, but that they have little trepidation when the public knows they are doing so. <S_SEP> , political rot i don't think an independent prosecutor is going to happen. and i don't think anything but outright meddling on the part of the trump regime is going to occur. <br/><br/>what's more, even if an independent investigation occurred and wrongdoing was found, i don't think the gop congress would impeach. they only impeach democrats. the political rot is just too deeply set for standard course correction -- only increased voter turnout for 2018 and sweeping the gop majority out is going to give the country a hope of moving forward on these matters. <br/><br/>the mendacity of the trump regime is staggering, and they're counting on the media normalizing them and congressional complicity to enable them to skate on by. <S_SEP> is destroying our democracy as we know it just to give a few thousand billionaires a tax cut really worth it? <S_SEP> wait....trump lied?<br/><br/>oh....that's not news. <S_SEP> the class divisions with disparity in income equality and core values in the united states have widened enormously since automation and outsourcing have deprived vast swaths of the nation of sufficient income to maintain or, among the young, earn their way into a lifestyle affordable by any able bodied man and women forty to fifty years ago. no attempt was made to distribute a truly significant, substantial and sufficient corporate profits and federal government assistance to those badly harmed by the advances of technology and cheap labor abroad. paul ryan's all out war on medicaid and other institutions that provide minimum medical care to those most in need and the humane values those institutions embody is an example what the very well healed establishment thinks about these people, the people largely responsible for the election of donald trump and all he represents to the despair of our global community. if anything, divisions in this country will widen. all of us will suffer enormously because of how very badly the lower classes have, are, and will continue to be treated in our country now that we've clearly lost our moral compass. <S_SEP> as shown by nunes and gowdy today, we need an independent investigation. the problem is not leaks, it's russian interference-a national security issue. <S_SEP> <br/>time to get a special prosecutor and put trump and team trump under oath.<br/><br/>they will be long gone but our election process will be tainted if we do not deal with this now. <S_SEP> i don't know if trump belongs to putin, but he certainly is acting like he is. even in the friendly confines of bill o'reilly's studio, trump would rather smear the us than criticize putin. there might be treason going on, and the republicans who refuse to investigate are accomplices after the fact. this is the most unpatriotic act by american politicians since the civil war. <S_SEP> it has just been announced that tillerson, the supposed secretary of state is not attending a nato meeting next month, but traveling to moscow, instead. tillerson is the same man who has received commendations from little putin's russia.<br/><br/>little putin has a traitor/spy in the oval office, and one in the state department. when will congress wake up? where are the patriots in the gop? is the gop willingly jeopardizing the national security of the united states to spite democrats? if so, paul ryan, mitch mcconnell are traitors to the united states. <S_SEP> , trump's downfall you're right. when trump goes down, he's bound to take some of them with him. why are so many of them willing to risk this? <S_SEP> it is alarming in all of those dimensions. very alarming. i am sure that he did a deal with russia and so "owes" them. i hope it results in his impeachment. <br/><br/>i think that trumps instincts were to rouse the rabble into a hatefest against snowflake liberals. the rabble having been groomed by fox. he needed a prototype strongman - and that was putin. he needed a group of people to hate - that was the hispanics. <br/><br/>but the media including the nytimes have played into his hands. the nytimes's conflation of legal and illegal immigrants by the times made it impossible to disentangle trumps conflation of illegal immigrants and all hispanics. the nytimes assumption that free trade is good for all (when it is not) and that the fed keeping zirp so long it starved savers and retirees, and the mantra that all protectionism, makes it impossible now rationalize that pinpointed protectionism is good and trumps blanket protectionism is bad. <br/><br/>i have been saying this for the last year. at first my comments were not even posted because it was against the popular dogma. i said watch out for trump. <br/><br/>and now we have him as essentially a chaotic distraction for the extreme right wing to take over our country and our courts. <S_SEP> like mr kristof and many americans, i believe it’s essential (albeit too late) for president trump to release his taxes. let's not be naive, though—who among us believes that trumpllc submits truthful returns? <S_SEP> exactly!! follow the dots...all the way to trump and beyond!! he is guilty for sure... <S_SEP> looking forward to seeing trump's "perp walk". <S_SEP> why do we need trump's permission to see trump's tax returns? the us treasury, specifically the irs, already has trump's tax returns. we only need a law declaring that the president's tax returns shall be made public information.<br/><br/>there is no constitutional issue in making the president's tax returns public information. the constitution does not guarantee the privacy of any person's tax returns, since the us income tax and the requirement for individual tax returns did not exist when the constitution was written in the 18th century. the income tax and the associated requirement to file tax returns were introduced in the late 19th and early 20th century. there is no mention of them, or of any right to keep them secret, in the constitution. <br/><br/>we need to pass a law making the tax returns of the president, and his highest officials, public information. they are already required to submit this information to the treasury. it should be made public. <S_SEP> 11. one more: after the election, after president obama's expulsion of russian agents and diplomats which followed 17 security agencies' conclusion on russian intervention in the election, were promises made in january by the incoming team to lift u.s. sanctions on russia that had been imposed by the obama team over the russian invasions of ukraine? it was quite telling that russia didn't expel u.s. people as its quid-pro-quo to such a u.s. action. <S_SEP> trump self-aggrandizement is the only interest the man has. <S_SEP> i can`t help myself to see the sharp contrast between president bush and current one donald j. trump.<br/>while mr. bush same age as trump already resurfaced with a new life, trump is going more and more toward the gutter with lies and more of it.<br/>in the process he is taking the whole country down with his desire to enrich himself and his family . <br/><br/>how much does one needs ? <S_SEP> keep up the pressure! the american people deserve a thorough investigation. <S_SEP> follow the russian ring prostitute and you will find how many trump's aides are involved. <S_SEP> remove trump and you get .... pence<br/>remove trump and pence and you get .... ryan<br/><br/>the fish is not only rotten at the head. <S_SEP> whew! the clintons must be thrilled that all media attention is focused on trump and russia 24/7. is one to assume that the fbi, cia and the ever faithful msm are giving thd clinton family foundation a pass on their "pay to play" illicit and illegal shenanigan? <S_SEP> as we connect trump's dots to russia, do we also need to start connecting trump's dots to china? the industrial &amp; commerce bank of china, a state-controlled enterprise and the world's biggest lender by assets, is also trump tower's largest office tenant. yesterday, the chinese trademark office provisionally granted trump 38 trademarks. that is the same chinese government entity that had denied trump those naming rights for a decade even as chinese-owned businesses used his name..... <S_SEP> trump or comey ?????? <S_SEP> there seems to be a consensus that russia was involved in at least some of the leaks that damaged the clinton candidacy. also, fbi director comey stated that russian involvement was more to damage clinton (who appeared to be a shoe-in for election) than to help trump. damaging your enemy is the essence of us politics so the distinction doesn't have any practical effect.<br/><br/>but if we assume that putin really thought that trump had a chance to win, what would be the benefit of any coordination with the trump campaign? can anyone imagine putin doing anything different based on input from trump? why would either side take such a risk?<br/><br/>so yes, trump is a sleazy businessman with business deals in russia. but he has probably benefitted less from his ties to russia than bill clinton did. <S_SEP> i have no trouble believing that trump, and his campaign leaders, were in favor of a relationship with russia that could be corrupt and self-interested. i have no trouble believing that russian strategists looked at trump and recognized the disruptive force he would become, and decided to undermine clinton as a result. i have no trouble believing that russian strategists have information on a lot of trump cronies that is damaging. i have no trouble believing that the russians saw trump as a strategic win. <br/><br/>i don't think the trump campaign *had* to collude with the russians, and i don't think they agreed to attack the us election. it isn't as if russia needed permission. <br/><br/>but the whole thing puts trump's administration in a terrible light - that they are so insulated from reality that they don't know when they are being used. that is a significant flaw for the leader of the free world to have. trump, over and over again, projects himself not as the great leader he sees when he looks into his magic mirror, but a puppet and a pawn to interests that are not america's favor. <S_SEP> we must have an independent prosecutor or we will not get to the truth.<br/>trump has proven how adept he is at changing the dialogue and at deliberately lying. <S_SEP> there certainly is smoke ... we need a thorough, independent investigation to see if there is any fire. <S_SEP> lets not forget that during the campaign trump publicly invited the russians to hack and release clinton's emails. they did just that. if that is not collusion, what is?<br/><br/>as it becomes clearer and clearer that trump is seriously unhinged, the responsibility for what happens to our country falls on the republican party as they protect him from the consequences of his crazy behavior. certainly there should be an independent council investigating the connections to russia and certainly there should be a general denouncement of trumps baseless smear of obama. however, the republicans are apologists and enablers, just going about the business of making rich people richer and poor people poorer, while the country drifts further and further from our basic values. <S_SEP> "failing to learn and heed the lessons of last year’s campaign would be an abdication of a shared responsibility to safeguard american democracy."<br/><br/>i am in doubt as to whether the gop want to safeguard our american democracy any longer. their automatic reflex is to shove this all under the rug and scream "nothing to see here" while lobbing absurd accusations at the previous administration. if they are not guilty what are they scrambling so hard to cover up? they are distancing themselves from flynn and paul manafort as fast as their little legs and tiny hands will carry them. meanwhile you have miller saying; "the authority of the president will not be questioned!" achtung baby! the authority of the president is being undermined by the president himself! his lies are transparent. his obfuscation embarrassingly obvious. his repeated late night twitter tirades odious and infantile. not only the president but the entire gop seem ok with russia hacking our elections as long it plays to their political advantage. they couldn't care less about safeguarding our american democracy. their only concern is catching that awful leaker as soon as possible! cover up much? there is word for people like trump, bannon, miller &amp; the gop. traitors. <S_SEP> tax returns!<br/>tax returns!!<br/>tax returns!!! <S_SEP> the problem is that trump doesn't hold democracy in much esteem. <S_SEP> timing is everything. <S_SEP> , russia and trump affair what the times glosses over is that if the trump team was being investigated before the election for possible collusion with the russians, there would necessarily have to have been surveillance of some kind which obama knew or should have known was taking place. if so, then trump's accusatory " wiretap" tweet, while crude, isn't so far from the mark.<br/><br/>what if the investigation( independent or otherwise) finds 1. no collusion between the trump team and the russians; 2. that obama had directed that such an investigation take place;, and 3. the people conducting the investigation under obama's auspices leaked the findings. will the nytimes issue an apology for its relentless pursuit of trump and turn its condemnation against the obama administration? not likely. <S_SEP> we need to write or call our congressional representatives, shame them into investigating. <S_SEP> i think trump sees himself as some sort of messiah instead of a civil servant. yes donald, the presidency is an honor not a spoil.<br/><br/>because trump isn't intellectual he is drawn to the appearance and power of russian strong men: rich, surrounded by beautiful women, and success in pursuing in shady deals.. <br/><br/>what draws trump to putin is the cult of personality.<br/><br/>but don't forget the heavy influence of steve bannon, whose white nationalism is in line with trumps anti-immigrant furor. trump is actually actually bannons ticket to an ugly worldview whereby whites, actually christian whites, partner with russia to fight islam.<br/><br/>the greatest danger of bannon is ultimate goal of swinging trump to his own worldview, which is based on eradicating muslims from the face of the earth. when it comes to russia, bannon is using trump for his own means.<br/><br/>putin has a head start on this, and donald is trying to play catch-up ball by flouting our constitution and mimicking the gestures, look, and swagger of dictators.<br/><br/>as rachel maddow put it last night, staring into the camera, this is what we are acing: the future of democracy in a country where a growing despotic presidency is consolidating our via a justice department headed by a loyalist ag whose loyalty to trump is stronger than his oath to protect the constitution.<br/><br/>yes trump has ties to russia and they may be deep, but we will never know with jeff sessions installed as top cop. <S_SEP> liddy in dealy said, "first off, no electoral "process" was interfered with, hacked or had otherwise been victim to tampering."<br/>true, in a way. there is no evidence in direct tampering with voters/vote machines. that said, an election can be tampered with in myriad ways, only some of which have to do with such direct actions. putting out fake "news" &amp; releasing insider info with particular timing are interference as was the original hacking. obviously, your position is from the right. likely you are a trump supporter. fine, but that does not mean that russia did not interfere in the election in significant ways and it does not mean that they did not collude with americans in the venture. <S_SEP> republican don't investigate republicans. you know the gop motto," party before country." as long as trump is willing to go along with gop congressional agenda, all is good in the world. <S_SEP> it is time for soxared to become a preferred commenter! <S_SEP> of course they also hacked the gop. the gop are scared of what they have. russia will keep it until they need leverage. scary. <S_SEP> can't hold a candle to whitewater!<br/><br/>now that was a scandal!<br/><br/>wait a minute. maybe i should be worried about americans conniving with russians to elect an american president who would be beholden to whom? hmmm. this will take a lot of thought!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair, ukraine affair "sessions seems a red herring, in that he wasn’t a secret conduit to the kremlin."<br/><br/>this is simply an assertion based on noting at all.<br/><br/>let's turn the story around, and ask how many "inexplicable" things suddenly make sense if team trump colluded with putin in rigging the election. this is not proof, but suggests things to consider and investigate.<br/><br/>if team trump was in bed with mr. putin, then it is highly unlikely that jeff sessions lied under oath for no reason at all about meeting with the russian ambassador, and refused to clear up misunderstandings over the past two months. the timing suggests that sessions and the russian may have discussed the forthcoming wikileaks release of clinton's emails and russia's fake news campaign.<br/><br/>mr. trump's inflated claims about his electoral victory, corrupt votes and the historic crowd at his inauguration have broadly been explained by his emotional insecurity. the alternative view is that trump knows eventually his legitimacy will come under scrutiny, after it comes out the election was rigged. <br/><br/>why did mike flynn lie to vp pence about his conversations with the russians, and why did trump keep pence in the dark about those lies? if flynn and trump knew they were breaking the law, they would naturally have kept pence in the dark because pence could have used evidence of wrongdoing to unseat trump and replace him in office. when it comes to impeachable offenses, the interests of trump and pence are at odds with each other. <S_SEP> trump seems to think he can tapp us if he wishes...jtrig, did you reverse the charges? <S_SEP> i think there are even more dots than this. i'm not advocating tin foil hats or anything, but this stuff is so suspicious.<br/><br/><a

target="_blank">http://www.dailykos.com/story/2017/2/26/1638034/-follow-the-money-tiller...</a><br/><br/>perhaps putin didn't think trump could actually win (as the new yorker said, they were like robbers who wanted blow the door off the safe but wound up blowing up the whole safe and its content), but there would certainly be a lot to be gained by having a friendly us president. <S_SEP> it is possible that the trump campaign colluded with the russians during the election. but let us not forget, very few people thought mr. trump would win the election. surely mr. putin did not expect him to actually win. <br/><br/>the russians interfered in the u.s. election, which is a bipartisan issue and a very serious threat to american democracy. however, i believe the russians' motive was more anti-clinton than pro-trump. they wanted to sow the seeds of doubt and distrust, and weaken american institutions.<br/><br/>the real issue is mr. trump's conflicts of interest. where is the reporting on the emoluments clause, and the lawsuit by mr. painter and mr. eisen?<br/><br/>the emolument clause is the issue we should be focused on. mr. trump's taxes (which we will probably never see) are likely a red herring. any quid pro quo with the russians (if it exists) would likely be hidden through a byzantine labyrinth of shell corporations. mr. trump probably doesn't want to release his taxes because: (1) he is not as rich as he claims, and may even have a negative net worth; and (2) he has not paid federal taxes for decades -- which he has already hinted at.<br/><br/>mr. trump's weakness is not the russian connection in the election hacking. rather, it is his conflicts of interest. his companies, that he did not divest from, are accepting money from foreign governments for which he has influence as potus. (this might include, but is not limited to, the russians.) <S_SEP> every major newspaper in the us ought to be running front-page editorials demanding the release of trump's tax returns. every democratic senator and representative and every living former potus ought to be holding press conferences demanding the release if trump's tax returns. pressure needs to be exerted continually. there is no defensible reason why trump's tax returns have nit been made public. <S_SEP> putin is a kgb agent. his training in the kgb has given him the ability to consolidate his power in the kremlin so that he is unchallenged for that power. this was possible not because of coincidence or chance, but from careful and long term planning, playing the proverbial "long game".<br/><br/>follow the money. trump was an asset that was easily acquired. his high profile public persona along with his business troubles gave putin easy access to trump. investigate all of the people who have invested in trump properties and the timeliness of those investments. when you begin to see how these monies came just when trump business need it most the rest becomes obvious. it is not so difficult to believe that those persons who gave trump the money he needed to bail himself out did not also ask for certain favors. putin, being the cagy kgb man, would not make any requests of trump that would seem untoward, just enough to make him a willing asset in the attempt to throw our country into disorder. trumps well known ego, along with his money problems, made him an easy acquisition.<br/><br/>show us the relationships between the russian investments and the trump business paying off its debts, and you will see the purchase of the asset. why would someone pay $55,000,000 more than trump paid, for a property that no one else had any interest in, at the time that real-estate property values were crashing, and then demolish it later to be resold at a significant loss for land value? <S_SEP> so do you want to see his k-1s (which tell you nothing except his share of gains or losses from each partnership) or do you want to see the detailed 1065 tax returns from each of his 400 partnerships? to do that, of course, you need permission from the other partners. and then, like kristof, will you call his deductions for depreciation a "loophole" inferring he's done something shady, even though every business in the free world is allowed to depreciate their fixed assets for tax purposes? trump has been audited by the irs every year, never charged with any wrongdoing, yet you are convinced he is doing something criminal? why do you harbor these fantasies? <S_SEP> they tried to impeach bill clinton over sexual improprieties with an aide. yet trump is still in office after this incredible admission front the fbi? after a barrage of delusional tweet rants that threaten<br/> our ties with our closest allies??? that brings wwiii rapidly closer??? does the world have to explode from trump's careless and uncaring behavior before the impeachment process begins??? <S_SEP> tax returns from a life long con artist like trump may not be as revealing as people think. <S_SEP> i think the real key to getting to the bottom of the trump - russian connection is following the money. trump has shown his willingness to partner with unsavory oligarchs around the world, that we know. the question is "why"? and the answer to that question lies in his tax returns. and trump's refusal to make them public is all the evidence we need to see to know that he needed their money in order to maintain his veneer of business acumen. he was, i'd bet, dependent upon them for his very economic survival.<br/><br/>was there collusion with the russians regarding the clinton/dnc hacking? that will be harder to prove because that was a purely russian move that was not dependent upon any decision-making by trump or his people. at worst, the trump minions were aware of it and did nothing to prevent it. it will be difficult to tie that directly to clinton's defeat. she and the dnc did a nice job of that themselves.<br/><br/>so what we have left is a pompous, ignorant, narcissistic liar who has hidden his most damning faults from investigators. and that alone justifies impeachment just as it did with nixon. <br/><br/>so let's have a look at those tax returns so we can see just how deep trump's reliance on the oligarchs really was. the quid pro quo to the greatest enemy of democracy will then be evident to all. <S_SEP> what right to privacy does a president have? what right to national security does america have?<br/><br/>does it matter that the president has exchanged favors with a foreign power? does it matter that the power is an adversary of america? does it matter that the exchange strengthens the foreign power and weakens america?<br/><br/>the president has some right to privacy, but in this case it is outweighed by country's interest in national security. <S_SEP> trump has no limits; he recognizes none, not even the constitution. it's what separates him from every other president, even nixon. is faith in rod rosenstein, nominated for deputy attorney general, merited? rosenstein is best known for prosecuting retired marine gen. james e. cartwright for leaking classified information to david e. sanger, chief washington correspondent for the new york times. would rosenstein focus on a prosecution concerning the connections between president trump's campaign and russia's efforts to sabotage the presidential election or, following the republican strategy of obfuscation to protect trump, instead prosecute the person(s) who revealed the treasonous activity? at his confirmation hearing rosenstein said that while he had "no reason to doubt" the findings of u.s. intelligence that russia influenced the presidential election, he would not yet consider appointing special counsel. why? he hadn't bothered to read the declassified intelligence report. rosenstein asserted that he could see no reason why he would be unable to oversee the investigation. still, if rosenstein somehow appointed a special prosecutor, and an investigation lead to impeachment, conviction, and removal, does anyone seriously believe trump would just accept it and step aside? far more likely trump would use rallies to inflame the radicalism of his already radical followers, label the whole thing a conspiracy, and foment a violent confrontation which could engulf the country. <S_SEP> it the tax returns stupid. get them and follow the money. <S_SEP> examples of proper usage of "air quotes":<br/>-- "president" trump;<br/>-- the trump "administration". <S_SEP> i hope he cuts them loose and makes them so angry they decide to turn state's witness on trump's sorry self. <S_SEP> the way i see it and applying cold, hard logic, why would putin stop with the election? obviously he has leverage over the trump organization as all the money that have flown into it did so with putin's consent. having trump as president and a cabinet that's working to dismantle everything that's good about our country, weakening our democracy and democratic institutions, dragging the country into constant war, spending money on building wall and hollowing out the state department under the guidance of tillerson, all work very well for putin. my question: is putin still meddling in our government? <S_SEP> trump could resolve all by ordering doj to produce the warrant signed by a federal judge. if it exist, it shows evidence a judge believed trump or someone in his circle is committing a felony or espionage. if the warrant doesn't exist, it proves trump is a liar.<br/><br/>heads trump loses, tails trump loses. <br/><br/>this is why he ordered the investigation, it will be long lasting, expensive and like benghazi willl produce nothing. trump believes by that time, just like "secretly a muslim born in kenya" the public will have forgotten.<br/><br/>a sucker is born every minute and trump seems to have cornered the market. <S_SEP> although the fbi may be hampered by trump et al, now that the investigation has been announced, the public will be watching and will require the truth. the 'enormous damage' is to the trump administration for the possibility of collusion with russia, let alone the possibility of proof being found. <S_SEP> , trump voters, voting trump voters were totally ashamed to admit they were voting for him. imagine voting for a person to hold the most important position in the world and being too embarrassed to admit it. after he won, then many of his voters jumped out of the shadows whooping it up "i voted for him!! i picked the winner!! i won! we are winning!!"<br/><br/>when a candidate is predicted to win by a large margin it actually discourages people from going to the polls which may have hurt clinton. in no way did it help her. <br/><br/>trump claimed that obama "had me" wiretapped. most of us believe "had me" means "ordered" or did it himself. comey was asked if obama ordered wiretapping. so responding that obama did not "order" wire tapping makes sense. there was a lot more said, and you know that. like presidents cannot order wiretapping. trump brags all the time about how good he is at keeping his trump tower secure so if he's got proof he was wiretapped let him show it to the american people. since trump ordered the investigation into his false accusation i am sure he had all the security services we have in the us to check his trump tower for taps. where's the beef? <S_SEP> the testimony was that they also hacked the rnc. they just didn't release anything they found there because they weren't trying to undermine the republicans. the russians were very clear that the republicans would be far easier for them to control than the democrats. they were right. <S_SEP> the smart guy in america being bannon, certainly not trump. <S_SEP> , election if trump is guilty then they are all guilty, especially of the cover-up. we need to have a new election in november. "let the people speak." <S_SEP> the republicans will never allow the appointment of an independent prosecutor or a select committee to investigate the trump campaign's treasonous collusion with the russians to corrupt the 2016 presidential election. they rode the trump horse this far &amp; they will not get off until they achieve their long-sought political goals. the idea that republicans will put the very concept of american democracy ahead of their party is ludicrous. they will create straw arguments. they will obfuscate. they will lie. they will kick our allies to the curb. the republicans will create whatever chaos is necessary to preserve their political power. count on it. <S_SEP> the spin here is dizzying. the confirmation of an ongoing investigation into the trump campaign's connections with the russians seems to confirm that trump associates were being surveilled. it seems to confirm what we already knew when the flynn leak came out--that some party in the us government had the trump campaign under surveillance. except for the word "wiretapping," and the claim that "obama" personally ordered the surveillance, this confirmation seems to lend more credence to trump's charges rather than less. <br/><br/>but it also raises the big question about what the fbi has found. strange how similarly comey plays his hand--announcing that there is no evidence of clinton email crime, announcing that there is no evidence of trump collusion, and yet stoking the fires of suspicion at the same time. <br/><br/>what is his game? <S_SEP> are you saying the time is partisan? <br/><br/>pshaw <S_SEP> watching and listening to the gop's scripted deflections about "the leaks" coming out of the doj and fbi was an absolute stunning display by them of dereliction of duty.<br/><br/>seriously someone needs to tell the gop that they're supposed to be on team america - <br/><br/>if someone within the trump sphere of operations has been or still is committing high crimes and misdemeanors and or treason you would think the gop would be as interested as every other american is in finding, prosecuting and imprisoning anyone found guilty in a court of law of such crimes.<br/><br/>yet the gop seems more interested in protecting vlad and donnie then they do about protecting america.<br/><br/>a pox on any american who would "sell out" this country and anyone who would aid and abet them like the gop did today! <S_SEP> until trumpeters call for the release of trump's tax returns, they have no credibility; just gullibility. <S_SEP> what a strange, strange man. he's enough to make you believe in extra-terrestrials. <S_SEP> as little respect as i had for republicans in congress going into the hearings, i now have significantly less. <S_SEP> as if all this isn't bad enough, the new yorker chimes in with a blistering report of yet another monied family behind trump, bannon and breitbart. they're not even russian. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency"

target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-ty...</a> <S_SEP> the only way government officials will regain public respect is through a good faith, nonpolitical investigation, starting with trump's taxes. nothing less will do. <S_SEP> the republicans speeded up the aca repeal program to change the subject from trump's over the top tweets about wiretapping, comey's request to doj to stop it, the sessions business, etc. nonetheless this is going to blow skyhigh because it is not just the nyt or wp investigating trump's russian connection, there are foreign intelligence agencies investigating, too. they are going to find something, and the republicans know it. <S_SEP> , russia and u.s. election good writing. all five of your explanations are plausible and logical based on reported information. i tend to lean toward the money angle and at this stage of your article, i think your counsel is a wise course to take. <br/><br/>i have been amazed that president trump continues to lie about his russian connection. of course, he is not under oath so i suppose he rationalizes that he will say whatever it takes to continue to serve.<br/><br/>i am not as certain about the russia-related inquiries by the f.b.i. and the senate intelligence committee, these inquiries are behind closed doors and the public does not have access to their evidence. ultimately, the president will be tried in the court of public opinion and hopefully the opinion is based on evidence based findings by the investigators.<br/><br/>the big question for me is the president's "russophilia" harmful to the economic, environmental and military security of the united states. i am already troubled by the reports that russia influenced the outcome of the november 2016 election and the suggestions from many sources that the trump campaign was complicit in their meddling with false or misleading information.<br/><br/>there is much at stake, i suggest that it would appear that the investigation should be elevated to a higher level "commission" and the hearings and evidence made more public by televised proceedings.<br/><br/>public hearings would expose the frailties of the us democracy but it may lead to reforms that would not happen otherwise. <S_SEP> the main point i get from this article is that trump or trump tower was 'wiretapped" or under us government surveillance. so trump was correct after all...interesting. <S_SEP> agreed. based on what we know, an independent commission is more than justified. and the reasonable working hypothesis at this point is that there was collusion between the campaign and russian intelligence to damage hillary clinton, because nobody believed trump would win the election--including trump himself. <br/><br/>an important question is, why manafort to lead the campaign after it became clear in 2016 that trump was going to win the republican nomination? manafort had been out of us politics for a decade, having become a political hack for dictators such as yanukovych of the ukraine. and why tillerson?, whom trump had never met before he won the election, and who has deep ties to russia. as documented by rachel maddow on her msnbc show, tillerson is now gutting the state dept.'s career experts in ways never seen before. russia benefits from less capable american diplomacy and soft power.<br/><br/>you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to conclude that a comprehensive, truth-finding, independent commission is needed to get to tell the full story of the 2016 election, plus any ongoing collusion with russia since trump's inauguration. <S_SEP> show us the money! we want to see trump's taxes.<br/>then we will begin to play connect the dots.... <S_SEP> if not collusion and quid pro quo, then how to explain the subsequent dismantling of the state department and silencing of our secretary of state? <S_SEP> i see an impeachment before the one year mark of trump's presidency. <S_SEP> it looks like donald trump's poor ratings for his new reality show, puts it on the verge of being cancelled. <S_SEP> most of the answers are in the tax returns of the so-called president.<br/><br/>he should be hammered and badgered incessantly until they are released. no hearings for gorsuch, no more nominations of judges at any level, until tax returns are released. <S_SEP> i'm afraid trump's followers, like trump himself, are incapable of being jolted back to reality. they're permanently in lalaland, with no chance of return. <S_SEP> yes, the new yorker has just put out a great piece on trump baku. <S_SEP> , lieing, gp, responsibility, trump and co i really do not think "president" trump has enough smarts to engineer any sort of deal to steal the election and the people around him really do not seem to bright ether. i wonder if sessions can find the light switch in a room? what this does prove to me is trump and his team along with the gop will say and do anything, throw anybody under the buss to deflect responsibility for anything. the gop impeached bill clinton for lying about really private business while they endorse their lair in chief president. <S_SEP> , russia and trump, ukraine and ivanka trump trump, family, staff appointee ties to russia: #1-campaign manager manafort worked as lobbyist ($12+ million) for russian-backed former ukrainian president; #2-u.s. intelligence agencies confirm elements in the russian dossier that targeted trump (the business insider - 2/10/17); #3-trump's many ties to russian citizens (the american interest, 12/19/16); #4-trump server communicates with russia (slate magazine, 10/31/16;) #5- fbi scrutinized trump foreign policy advisor carter page on suspicion of private communications with senior russian officials/security, also see roger stone; #6-putin set to ink $500b oil development deal with exxon once sanctions lifted (sec of state tillerson former exxon ceo); #7-russia paid bloggers to release fake news stories critical of clinton; #8-wikieleaks under russians tutelage only published democratic party-hacked information to harm them during the election; #9-trump invites russia to hack clinton's account; #10-trump disputes the proof provided by 17 u.s. intelligence agencies of russian hacking of the 2016 election; #11-trump insults and threatens other countries and long-time u.s. allies but goes out of his way to defend putin; #12-trump named flynn national security advisor (see r.t. etc.); #13-ivanka trump is a friend of wendy deng (ex-wife to rupert murdoch), who dated putin, ivanka is a murdoch trustee; #14-white supremacists support trump under bannon's alt-right platform idolize vladimir putin as the last white race savior. <S_SEP> excellent thought-provoking comment. the word i would use to describe the trump administration is surreal. <S_SEP> i bet trump is doing this to protect not only himself, but a long time colleague. see references to roger stone in another article. <br/><br/>my bet is we'll find out that roger stone worked with the russians to help trump. early in the campaign trump was probably either unaware or didn't care. later, it worried him and he distanced himself from stone, after which stone may or may not have continued efforts to help trump, without trump's knowledge and/or blessing. <S_SEP> , russia and trump, ukraine and nato worse than the possibility of collusion is that trump's behavior strongly indicates that the kremlin has something on him. trump is very transparent. he supports the kremlin, if not defends them, praises them, and he desperately wants the fbi investigation shut down. conversely, he hangs up the phone on the australian prime minister, accuses the british of spying on him, and belittles nato. using ockham's razor, trump is compromised. <S_SEP> to my mind trump is so amoral that he wouldn't have even seen anything wrong with collusion with the russians to get help with the election - he probably thought that was normal and fine. because that kind of thing is how he does business. <S_SEP> the gop does not have a shred of ethical decency. these are moral criminals who hold twisted self serving philosophies. how they can breathe the same air ( as long as air is breathable) as decent fellow americans is astonishing to me. they need to destroy themselves and not us. <S_SEP> many of you reading this will be from new york city. many more will be from united states. as a canadian, i can assure you that people all over the world are very invested in this process and following it very closely. the future of the planet may rely on this, both from a nuclear threat perspective, as well as environmental perspective. much of the commentary that i have read here, in the comments section, shows how much people care and how much thought is being put into this. i ask that you continue to do this, that you continue to show your passion. as a foreigner, i can have very little influence on what happens in the us. like many others, i therefore rely on you. and lest you think that it's the way it should be, that all of this should be decided within the united states, what's really important to recognize is that the united states is still, by far, the most powerful country in the world. given this is the case, the world now more than ever has a vested interest in the leadership of the united states of america. while i believe that it is only a matter of time before the president is impeached, it is you, the american people, with the help of the "dishonest media," who will make this happen. much of our lives is spent living in a world where we do not have the opportunity to do something really great, and to live up to our ideals, but here you do have this opportunity. please do not let it go to waste. <S_SEP> this needs to be fully investigated--no cover ups or paper overs. lets see if these gop senators are as honorable as the gop senators who investigated watergate. so far, i don't see that they are. <S_SEP> a danger is what donald trump may do now to change narrative. frankly, the us is in danger on many levels. national security must finally be addressed, up front &amp; center. world security, too (-written from buenos aires). <S_SEP> maybe all but the first of these are all true -- trump was indebted to russia, which extorted him with compromising material to ensure repayment, which then turned into a political opportunity for both parties, which is now going to benefit russia far more than the usa. i don't doubt that trump has a genuine affinity for putin, because he wishes he could be as smart and powerful. but trump isn't nearly so cunning, largely due to a lack of self-control. at the end of the day, although trump is attracted to putin's authoritarianism, and trump loves the white nationalist politics used to grow such centralized power, it is hard to believe he would take *this much* heat on the topic if there is not really a compromising situation. why would he get so easily boxed in? can you name a single other human being on earth that trump has defended at *literally every turn*????? <S_SEP> while these are cynical times, this is not a time for us to focus solely on the failings of government. the mere fact that the fbi is conducting its investigation is proof positive that our system works, provided that the fbi can, in fact, conduct a fair and impartial investigation, regardless of where the facts lead.<br/><br/>from a larger perspective, our job as citizens is to focus on how we can strengthen our governmental and political systems to prevent these catastrophic events from reoccurring. toward that end, it is incumbent on all of us to (among other things): force our elected representatives to remove the influence of big money in politics. we must end the ability of well-heeled political contributors, including super pacs, to contribute hundreds-thousands times more dollars than the limit allowed to individuals. at the grassroots level, we need to force our political parties to reform their nomination processes and direct their candidates' efforts toward more issues driven campaigns. we also must figure out ways to shorten the presidential campaign cycle to a more concise period of time, say, 6 months.<br/><br/>we are not powerless, despite how the present administration has made many to feel. what we see taking place now is a wake up call, the result of our apathy and indifference; we have failed to nurture the most precious gift bequeathed to us by the founding fathers -- democracy.<br/><br/>we are fortunate to have another chance to build what we want. let's begin now. <S_SEP> anybody who has studied the ussr and russia worries, because it is just impossible that there is nothing behind this strange affinity of trump to russia. he is just not that complicated.<br/><br/>in regard to your fourth possibility "the idea, contained in a dossier compiled by private investigators, that russia has compromising material on trump." i would not ignore it just because it sounds so far-fetched. i do not think they have any sex tapes. i think they have proof of financial deals and possibly they have his tax returns.<br/><br/>it was and continue to be about his tax returns. if he continues to stonewall on the tax returns, eventually they will be leaked by someone or some foreign state - and russia may just do it if trump does not dance. <S_SEP> name one place where we can see 10 years worth draft dodger trump's taxes. <S_SEP> the fact is that trump and his team could have encouraged russia to interfere in the election simply by communicating to them their desire to have friendlier relations with russia and to re-evaluate the sanctions imposed on russia for their annexation of the crimea. trump and his advisors would well know how russia could help them in the election based on russia's past interference in european elections. in fact, paul manafort, who was trump's campaign manager until he was forced out due to his russian connections, worked for a pro-russian candidate in the ukraine and so observed first hand how russia helped him. the fact that an anti-russian plank was dropped from the republican platform during the republican convention was an unmistakable signal from trump's campaign to vladimir putin that putin should do all he can to help trump, as was trump's call for the russian's to find hillary's "missing emails". <S_SEP> get the tax returns. you will probably find answers there. <S_SEP> the truth comes out, eventually, but we need it fast to save us from komrade trump. when it does we can only hope that those who helped trump suffer with him. <S_SEP> in the last few weeks, whenever there is a true story - he tweets about something insignificant and irrelevant at the same time to distract the american people. even the botched up release of the gop's health care plan is a plan to deflect attention from russia. interestingly, he achieves what he wants. ever since he made claims of president obama wiretapping him illegally, there has been little talk about anything else on television channels. i know he is president and his words need to be taken seriously. but this is a president like no other. he should be treated for what he is - a con artist. <S_SEP> during watergate, you could gather a bipartisan group of politicians who put country ahead of party. that may not be possible with the current gop. <S_SEP> , trump's policies in addition to the potential compromising material disclosed in the dossier, it appeared the trump organization was actually being used as a russian foreign intelligence asset in the u.s. and abroad. so far, trump's policies are confluent with putin's objectives in that they create domestic instability in the u.s., and undermine america's credibility abroad. it appears the trump administration is neutering all levers of soft power (like dos versus dod) in the u.s.; also confluent with putin's hatred of the u.s. dos, and clinton. that is not to mention trump and trump's people seem to embrace the illiberal authoritarian nationalistic theme of russian politics, also a theme with respect to russian information warfare in europe and abroad. on the russian economic front, the thrust seems to be elimination of sanctions to unleash russia's primary economic resource, oil. the mosaic paints a pretty interesting picture. <S_SEP> the full quote from donald trump, jr. is "and in terms of high-end product influx into the us, russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets; say in dubai, and certainly with our project in soho and anywhere in new york. we see a lot of money pouring in from russia. there's indeed a lot of money coming for new-builds and resale reflecting a trend in the russian economy and, of course, the weak dollar versus the ruble," <a

<br/><br/>my sense is that the "business conspiracy" explanation was first, and from that developed the "political conspiracy" and "ideological alliance" explanations. <br/><br/>as for the "blackmail" explanation, video or photographs of the current white house resident frolicking with one or more escorts in a moscow hotel would not upset a segment of his supporters. they would see it as demonstration of trump's machismo. <br/><br/>maybe the white house resident is trying to create good paying jobs for thousands of historians whom will study him for decades trying to unravel his motivations. <S_SEP> if by a ‘liberal’ they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people - their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties - someone who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies abroad, if that is what they mean by a ‘liberal’, then i’m proud to say i’m a liberal.<br/><br/>~ john f. kennedy, profiles in courage <br/><br/>true individual freedom cannot exist without

for the person, which does make you feel good, to be honest with you, i've done it many times.<br/><br/>~ donald j. trump <S_SEP> holding trump and his cronies to account is the start of fixing the problem. <S_SEP> yep. how will they defend having a president who has been elected with communist 'help' and intervention? the rest of the world, and i come from a third-world country, still cannot believe this guy was elected after all the nonsense he spewed during the last 18 months or so. <S_SEP> i smell smoke and i see fire.<br/>the circumstantial evidence supporting a claim that trump<br/>or a key trump campaign aide colluded with the russians<br/>to unduly influence the 2016 presidential election in trump's<br/>favor is powerful and compelling and warrants an independent investigation.. paul manafort trump's ex campaign manager<br/>who has close and long standing ties with the russians<br/>is the most likely candidate.<br/>that sounds like treason---<br/>conspiring with agents of a foreign government to<br/>unduly influence a national election in your candidate's favor.<br/>and if manafort colluded with the russians and committed treason<br/>and trump and the republicans hired manafort they are guilty too.<br/>much more important than tracking down the source of leaks---<br/>that's just a diversionary tactic---or chasing after clinton's e mails.<br/>trump the traitor to america? we shall see as the investigation proceeds.<br/>but an independent prosecutor is needed right now. <S_SEP> this is an administration that sacrificed everything to gain power. paul ryan sacrificed his dignity in backing trump so he could live out his teenage dreams of gutting medicaid. ivanka trump sacrificed her brand and image to stand by her man. steve bannon, who is much smarter than he gets credit for, sacrificed his ambition of a real revolution to have that revolution swallowed by the very swamp it promised to drain. putin sacrificed his stealth power behind the scenes to have it scooped out and dumped for all to see. trump sacrificed the american people, their reputation and safety, their trust in the electoral process just to win. he might have won anyway, without making a backroom deal with russia. but he, like so many americans, were seething with mass hysteria and hatred for hillary clinton that they were seduced into thinking anything goes. lock her up. expose her emails. no one will care, trump figured, because they barely thought she was human. america deserves better. godspeed, james comey. and good luck. you're going to need it. <S_SEP> surely some brilliant hacker could liberate trump's tax returns and make them public. offer a reward. and when they reveal what i believe they will impeach this loudmouth strongman from our sacred house. <S_SEP> a special prosecutor is hired to do just that, prosecute. at this time there is no evidence of collusion or anything other than folks meeting. since this has been going on so long already with nothing to report as numerous sources from both republician and democrat operatives and former office holders have stated, assigning a special prosecutor where no evidence of tampering from the white house has been shown is overkill.<br/><br/>as we have seen in the past, special prosecutors are like auditors who only get paid if they find something, pretty much working on commission. these folks run amock and follow any lead down any rabbit hole, regardless of the ties to the original review.<br/><br/>this is a common request, handled like it has to be done for independence purposes, where in reality it is a tool to prolong the pain for whatever party is being investigated.<br/><br/>as we saw yesterday, politicians have no agenda other than promoting themselves and their narrative. calling it a circus is too low a bar. we had our elected representatives testifying and then calling on the ones there to provide information to confirm the questioners testimony.<br/><br/>a special prosecutor would only allow for more theater and excessive costs to be spent to fund the cast.<br/><br/>let's let our processes run as intended and if we have tampering, i am sure the ones in charge of the agencies will report it if they are as honorable as the nyt appears to think they are. <S_SEP> trump speaks with both side of his mouth and has one overriding egocentric urge: to be admired by people.... his ego feeds on adoration...<br/>he refuses to release his tax returns, unlike any other former president. it is clear it contains information that could tarnish his reputation.<br/><br/>as investigations proceeds regarding his possible ties with putin and russia. what legal tools are available for the investigators, to make him release his tax returns? <S_SEP> circumstantial evidence in preponderance is grounds for conviction under most laws.<br/>take off the blinders america. the dots have connected sufficiently to paint a quite solid picture of interconnectedness. it's not a pretty picture but the more we resist acceptance the worse will be the damage and the longer a recovery will be.<br/>the smell of treason is in the air and the people must show the intelligence, security, and justice communities that they can proceed to implement the necessary actions with the full support of the people. without this support they will hesitate and wait for the congressional legal process to remove this treasonous group.<br/>that may or may not occur. <S_SEP> remember, they're responding to friends not foes. trump is unfailingly polite if he thinks he can get something from someone. <S_SEP> don--while i certainly agree that the republicans *should* put partisanship aside in this case, they will not do it. some 40% of the public actually approves of the job trump and his handlers are doing. since the republican base is about 40% of the electorate, that is virtually their entire base. they are not going to alienate their entire base by impeaching him. <S_SEP> i don't generally go for poetry but this is a keeper! <S_SEP> do not forget the tax returns! <S_SEP> one thing you are dead right on - manafort. follow the money. he is in deep and a bad dude. <S_SEP> trump runs to a corner of the country where he feels wanted, needed, admired, and even loved. immature behavior at best. <S_SEP> , russians and russian-affiliated people think about this:<br/>paul manafort consulted with russian agent while running the trump campaign <a href="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-russia-manafort-235850" title="http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-russia-manafort-235850" target="_blank">http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/trump-russia-manafort-235850</a><br/>... or that mike flynn got paid $40k from the russians before he was appointed national security advisor<br/><br/>wake up america!! are there no patriots left in the republican party?<br/><br/>it's absolutely breathtaking. <S_SEP> right on david, look hard at the motives (i.e., the "why") and its likely things will fall into place. the latter i.e., the ideological connection) seems increasingly plausible given trump's repeated rants (and previously flynn's) against radical islamic groups and the purported subsequent ban designed to keep said groups out, but really a thinly veiled action against muslims; this along with his grandiose pronouncements and character make-up makes one think he will accept nothing less than a putin-like presence as he seeks to have it all, in the process trampling over our democratic principles and seeking to dismantle institutions (i.e., the press, national media) that stand in his way. i could be wrong but i think following the money will not unearth the pot of gold here - the real answer is found in the person of the presence now residing on pennsylvania avenue, america's first tyrant. <S_SEP> then why lie? because the credulous gop droolers will believe lies they like <S_SEP> soon if not already there will be sufficient credible evidence for a grand jury to indict several of trump's collaborators with serious crimes. in the court off public opinion the issue is not leakes but whether the president of the united states is an agent of a hostile foreign power and collaborated with that power to damage or fatally destroy the bed rock of our most cherished democratic institutions. his power with the majority party it the real opportunity to advance its own anti american, anti-people agenda. the gop does not care what the costs are even though it is obvious that not only our system of government will be destroyed, which has been their object for years, but the electorate will be enraged. who cares they will believe the lies that will cook up. <br/><br/>with the assistance of russia, the trump conspiracy has opened a pandora’s box of authoritarianism, kleptocracy, theocracy, deception and lies, lies, and more lies, and attacks on insritutions that unite the country. the gop would like a coverup and will try thwir best. after all the rules that apply to democrats do not apply to them. they make up their own rules based on self interest. <br/><br/>the public must know that if they are successful in keeping a russian puppet in office the result will be a lawless police klepto state. at least mike pence was not getting his orders from the russians. that fact and the gop’s knowledge of it, will in the end be trump’s undoing. <S_SEP> the russians hacked the democratic party. we know what they have because they released it.<br/><br/>the russians also hacked the republican party, but have not (yet) released that information. what does mr. putin have on the republicans? <S_SEP> two words: tax returns. <S_SEP> "the goal must be to make american political parties and democratic institutions less vulnerable to efforts to distort the electoral process as the russians appear to have carried out. failing to learn and heed the lessons of last year’s campaign would be an abdication of a shared responsibility to safeguard american democracy."<br/><br/>wait!!! didn't the gop try to "distort the electoral process" in 2016? didn't gop controlled statehouses pass unconstitutional legislation limiting voting rights for poor minorities? based on what transpired at the state level it is not at all clear that the gop wants to safeguard american democracy? <br/><br/>and given the lack of will on the part of either party to repeal citizens united it appears that neither the democrats or the gop are really interested in safeguarding american democracy. they'd rather safeguard the money lobbyists give them to fill their campaign coffers.... <S_SEP> put yourself in putin's shoes. it's 2013-4, trump is making political noises. the russians assess and feel he is important politically. it would be trivial for them to steal trump's tax statements and basically build a complete dossier on his holdings, secret and open, around the world; record his phone calls; acquire photographic evidence of whatever. and as trump's position within the gop rose, their efforts would increase. and then at the right time, let trump's people know what they have. of course it might help that trump has people around him who do extensive business with putin and perhaps, to the extent trump has any real political views (which i doubt), similar politics. <S_SEP> kristof needs to read matt taibbi's latest in the rolling stone. all of this speculation is going to hurt if the dots do not eventually connect. there is a lot of smoke, but if the fire never arises, well, kristof, maddow, hayse, reid, et al. will be seriously damaged goods, like beck--who no reasonable person takes seriously. <S_SEP> we need, one way or the other, to see the tax returns. there can be no rational reason to withhold them. congress needs to do whatever it takes to get them released, so we can know for sure whether there are nefarious reasons for trump's russian behavior. failing action by congress, and fully recognizing the illegality of the action, someone inside the irs should disclose the tax returns. i see this as a patriotic act, as difficult as it would be to contemplate. only then will we know whether the president is telling the truth about many of the things he says about his financial dealings. count me among the skeptics! <S_SEP> the gop congress should ask themselves one simple question when deciding how to proceed in this investigation of potential russian influence and collusion in the 2016 election.<br/>"what would my response be if these allegations came out regarding an hrc presidency?"<br/>all members of congress have taken an oath to protect and defend the constitution and the country. they should act in accordance with that oath. <S_SEP> trump's credibility is at zero. isn't it congressional leaders who need to step up at this point? unfortunately, there are no leaders there. <S_SEP> i think the ratings are falling for trump's new show. pity. <S_SEP> aren't you getting a tad worked up here? <S_SEP> there is one critical dot, you have left out, mr. kristof. trump agreed 100% to the gop platform with one very notable ecxeption. <br/><br/>in the days leading up to the gop convention trump had one - just one - amendment he wanted to change in the gop platform: the sanctions against russia was to be lifted and russia's invasion ans annexation of crimea to be accepted.<br/><br/>the fact that these back room dealings also coincided with what we now know, that several meetings took place between the trump team and russian officials during those days is a huge red heering. <S_SEP> trump must be exhausted by now with all this winning. <S_SEP> trump's determined emphasis not to release his tax returns is a clear and very obvious indication that he is hiding unsavory activities that could seriously damage his presidency.<br/>congressional members have resorted to subpoena of documents that were of much less significance than trump's tax returns.<br/>it puzzles me why pursuing a subpoena of trumps tax returns are being studiously neglected, at every turn since his campaign..
in the name of democracy and to safeguard our constitution, it is time to abolish this administration. <S_SEP> when trump was elected it was like getting kicked in the balls. it makes you sick to your stomach and it hurts, when you recover you want to get even.<br/><br/>but not so for congressional republicans. because they don't have any balls. <S_SEP> be careful or you will soon be called an 'enemy of the state' by the president. <S_SEP> "failing to learn and heed the lessons of last year’s campaign would be an abdication of a shared responsibility to safeguard american democracy."<br/><br/>is it not too late for that already? now that trump has shown himself to be compromised in so many ways, with a rapidly growing international reputation as an intellectually limited, paranoid weakling, what is there for him or his team to learn that would let him rise to a viable presidency?the damage to democracy will not be repairable while he remains in office. <S_SEP> @look ahead...my vote is to revote. any other ideas? <S_SEP> it comes down to congress. is their loyalty to america or to having a republican in power? <S_SEP> follow the money... it's that simple.. in my book, pence has known all along, i do not buy that "deer in headlights" premise, they just need him to be squeaky clean to take over the helm. <S_SEP> i grew up paying attention to politics thanks to my family's dinner conversations, with parents who told me they were democrats but never told me who they voted for or trashed the gop. this was after watergate, but my parents hadn't given up on the system. i want to have the same optimism they seemed to have about the system as a whole, but it's tough to believe that the gop congress is really working for the people and not for their agenda, which they believe will be passed by this man who's now president. with the possibility of electoral interference by a murdering head of a foreign state, i really need for them to back an independent prosecutor. i want to be proud of our country and our system of government again, but i'm so far from it these days. <S_SEP> what are the odds that the republicans will grow enough of a conscience to so much as care about all this? <S_SEP> calling trump "45" is being too generous.<br/>i prefer "mr. 46 percent" <S_SEP> excuse me? where were you for the previous 8 years??? <S_SEP> i agree, i am so tired of hearing the r apologists. vote them all out. <S_SEP> when you see smoke, there's a fire. it make take time but it will be found. <S_SEP> "friendly deference" is too mild a description of how many republican lawmakers treat trump. try "fawning sycophancy." <S_SEP> nice to see that the business of the american people is so high up on every bodies agenda. <S_SEP> well stated! <S_SEP> we won't know the truth until the democrats control congress. i see this as a major campaign issue next year, along with the gop health care takeaway. <S_SEP> trump needs to resign now!<br/> before<br/>the lid blows <S_SEP> fifty shades of nixon.....republicans own this mess. <S_SEP> douglas e of texas: anything else but all-night publications available in texas these days?? <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine war, russia and ukraine government, trump's presidency ed, i think, however, that the media could make things hot enough for the republicans that they would be compelled to move on trump. actually, i would prefer that trump limp through a term and then face the electorate in 2020. if he should be impeached in short order, pence would serve out the rest of trump's term and then would be eligible for two terms of his own. congressional republicans would be pleased with such a development. for now, unless things get too hot, republicans in congress will hold their noses and support trump as long as he signs their legislation. <S_SEP> it makes me sad when so many commenters state that republicans must put country before party politics/ideology that is what republicans do and have done for many years. i don't believe they will change . . . and i don't believe in the tooth fairy. <S_SEP> use the "sarcasm font" <S_SEP> keep the pressure up. <S_SEP> for once in what seems like 20 years of #45 put your moral big-boy pants on gop. if this were hillary, you'd already be gathering the wood to burn her at the stake. <S_SEP> you can scoff at "kumbaya america," all you want but there are some of us who actually believe what the pledge of allegiance is about and that's "justice for all." "something that actually works for americans?" how about that health care bill? it "actually works" for health insurance ceos, not so much for poorer and sicker americans. your comments are like the fireball pitcher who has lost his fastball and is hoping that his new "sinking slider" will do the trick. not a good start for the trump administration and the all powerful republican congress, is it. <S_SEP> we need the investigation and let the chips fall. <S_SEP> the republican congress still believes it can use trump to promote plutocracy. <br/><br/>meantime trump's supporters give him undying support because he feeds their prejudices.<br/><br/>the country has not in my lifetime been in such danger. <S_SEP> a special prosecutor is needed now! <S_SEP> an independent prosecutor is needed now. <S_SEP> the times is doing a stellar job! right now we need our free press more than ever. and the times has stepped up to the plate day after day after day. as a reward for its dogged investigations and editorials, millions and millions more have subscribed, whether to the print edition or to its digital access.<br/><br/>i just switched my ditigal from monthly to yearly. and i foresee making use of this for decades to come. even if i need to flee the country.<br/><br/>bravo, grey lady! <S_SEP> greed and ego and lust for power at any cost...trumps logic <S_SEP> donald trump is the opioid president, using language like a narcotic to deny the grim reality. <br/><br/>the reality is that there is enough evidence for an fbi investigation underway that the trump campaign may have colluded with an antagonistic foreign power to rig the us election. if proven true this may land members of his campaign, including trump, in jail, blow apart his presidency, and bring a constitutional crisis what to do with a rigged election? no amount of verbal heroin can protect him or our nation from horrible consequences. <br/><br/>the 62,984,825 who voted for trump, out the more than 200,000,000 registered voters, or -2,868,691 compared with the 65,853,516 who voted for hillary clinton, must realize they were sold a pipe dream. the addiction to trump's opioid reality that is embraced by this sizable minority must be broken before it damages the economic and political health of our nation. <S_SEP> some of the points in the article assume trump has a capacity for ideologically-driven strategic thinking. i'm pretty sure no such thing exists. at the core of trump is his towering interest in self: self enrichment and self aggrandizement. there's no ideology there, only a pathological compulsion for 24/7 self promotion. in recklessly aligning himself with bannon, the alt-right...etc., he struck a long-shot deal with marginalized white christian nationalists, offering them a crack at legitimacy in return for the elevation of all things trump to unimaginable heights. to trump’s and everybody's amazement, the deal actually bore fruit causing the craven republican establishment to immediately rally around him in service to their own misguided ideological yearnings. so now we have the spectacle of nationalists duking it out with republicans over which awful, regressive policies to impose on the american people (and the world), while trump scrambles to protect his brand with its many international connections now legitimately open to public scrutiny, and representing spectacular conflicts of interest for a sitting president. it's only about money and ego for trump- the two legs of his infinitely unstable mind (and malleable world view) . which is why all investigative roads must lead to a thorough and public examination of trump’s tax returns. any investigation that doesn't compel trump to release all his tax records will be a farcical waste of taxpayers' money. <S_SEP> i'll go with the dossier theory. <S_SEP> his supporters for the most part are not sophisticated enough to connect the dots. even if they could they wouldn't believe or understand it. that's the problem. their representatives are only thinking of the next election and not what us actually happening to this country. <S_SEP> our president, may god help us, is an ignorant bully and a compulsive liar.<br/>he lies all the time, sometimes for no better reason than that it's his nature.<br/><br/>we're only two months into his presidency and already it is a disgrace to the nation. <S_SEP> great article, but i think you forgot a dot..."donald trump calls on russia to find hillary clinton’s missing emails" <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clinton-emails.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/us/politics/donald-trump-russia-clint...</a> <S_SEP> , gerrymandered election 2016 was a gerrymandered election. operation redmap which--along with new restrictive voter laws, the gutting of the voting rights act, and unlimited dark money (even from foreigners), led to gop state/control of 70% of electoral college votes. in the three states mentioned--each had strange things happen, wisconsin republicans arranged it so well that even when democrats received the majority of votes, republicans won more seats. after the election, the courts called "foul" but the damage was done. <S_SEP> i believe that senators mccain and graham may be the only republican senators who retain a sense of patriotism. the others would cheerfully sell american children into a cannibal meat-market in exchange for wealth and power. <S_SEP> mr. leonhardt, how can you say trump "merely flirts" with the alt right when his administration is being loaded with breitbart veterans? <br/><br/>bannon is the most visible, of course, and he probably is responsible for recruiting these people, but clearly the trump administration is doing far, far more than "merely flirt" with the alt right! <br/><br/>today the wapo reports on one of the latest hires: <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/for-a-trump-adviser-an-odyssey-from-the-fringes-of-washington-to-the-center-of-power/2017/02/20/0a326260-f2cb-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3ahomepage%2fstory" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/for-a-trump-adviser-an-odyssey-from-the-fringes-of-washington-to-the-center-of-power/2017/02/20/0a326260-f2cb-11e6-b9c9-e83fce42fb61_story.html?hpid=hp_hp-top-table-main_no-name%3ahomepage%2fstory" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/for-a-trump-advis...</a><br/><br/>these are dangerous people who pursue a radical right wing agenda and who have been responsible for polluting american media with "fake news" for many years now. trump does not listen to his intelligence briefings and has picked a fight with our intelligence community, but he does listen not just to fox news but also to the deranged right wing conspiracy theorist alex jones, who thinks sandy hook was a fake massacre and pushes the idea that 3-5m people voted illegally and only for clinton.<br/><br/>these people have no business being anywhere near our government. they operate in synch with putin's campaign to destabilize western democracies. they seriously endanger the security of this country. <S_SEP> this is a modern computer hacking world -- not that difficult if you get your hands on the right computer. <S_SEP> who is going to investigate comey? <S_SEP> a very sobering reveal occurred yesterday. we are diminished as a nation as a result.<br/> i have to wonder if ivanka moving into the white house as an aide is a sign of the further decline of her father. it's almost like he needs her around to keep his impulses in check. surely that would be of benefit. he seems mentally unstable to me and clearly clueless as to what the presidential role is when it doesn't involve a camera or a rally somewhere.<br/>the truth will come out but not without a fight and endless lies and accusations. i worry that as trump feels things slipping for him his actions will become more outrageous.<br/>it's going to be bumpy navigating through all this and an independent committee needs to steer. <S_SEP> who cares? <S_SEP> do you have any examples of the democratic party gerrymandering? only the republicans are afraid of a straight up vote. the gerrymandering that you see across the country is being conducted in republican states with republican governors. that's because they know truth will catch up to them and they'll be voted out for the next forty years unless they can rig the results. gerrymandering, voter suppression, out and out lying - that's how today's republicans get elected. <S_SEP> i do not understand why the gop will not push for an independent investigation, because it has nothing to lose. if trump gets impeached, the gop will still control the government, but without all the horrific tweets and lies. <S_SEP> if hillary behaved like trump with lies and russia, she would already be "locked up."
though we're all speculating, the article does not specify the hacks, propaganda, smears or tricks that would be more damaging to hillary if they were committed or assisted by russian intelligence, as opposed to the ruthless trump campaign working alone. one possible answer: the russians can lean on wikileaks, where assange has made it clear he despises hillary (as does putin) and advocates anarchism ("chaos"), as so many full-time hackers do. these dots need connecting too, even hypothetically, especially since bannon (manafort before him), assange, and putin all aim to "deconstruct" the u.s. "administrative state," post-modern jargon for tearing down democracy. trump helps this team by appointing unqualified people to some cabinet positions: several are there clearly to neutralize the power of their own agency. if the russian people play along with putin, and congress plays ball with trump, the planet will be run by two neo-fascist presidents, and there'll be only one dotted line left, the one between the wh in the west and the kremlin in the east. <S_SEP> fine and dandy with trump and (most) republicans when wikileaks, presumably via russian operatives, dribbled a steady stream of hacked dnc/podesta e-mails to sway our election. trump was willfully gleeful, as he openly invited russia to hack hillary's e-mail. all that mattered was that the "truth" was revealed, not the insidious, illegal manner in which it was revealed. he'd have been happy to keep flynn if leaks hadn't revealed his lies. he slanders obama with no proof. on and on and on. i realize democrats and republicans both make self-serving statements and can look hypocritical based on who is on the hot seat, but trump and repubs are taking this a bridge too far. two months ago today this man was inaugurated. it feels like a lifetime. a bad lifetime. <S_SEP> , cia wikileaks affair, trump i'd add another to your list. it's seriously weird that trump is gloating over the cia wikileaks thing. what normal president would celebrate having one of his departments hacked??? he's also not asking his new head of the cia to make sure it doesn't happen again. why? probably because he gave the order to the new cia head to pass on the info to putin's wikileaks. i mean, why else would he be gloating as if the cia is some kind of vanquished enemy? despite it happening on his watch ... not long after his new head is in place?<br/><br/>i'm sure it's high treason to pass off secret info on government workings to a foreign propaganda source like putin's wikileaks. but who's going to investigate?<br/><br/>what mafia don investigates himself??? and the gop pols are too busy grabbing their own share of the plunder. that's why they're moving so fast and ignoring input from their constituents. crooks always move fast. so i guess the government will be hollowed out and sold off for parts to the koch brothers and putin &amp; his pals. meanwhile the ordinary people of this once great nation will be left without much of anything. <S_SEP> donald trump came to the forefront of politics on the crest of a 5 1/2 year tsunami lie about barack obama's natural born citizen birth qualification to be president of the united states. <br/><br/>lying is part of trump's nature and nurture. a gnawingly morally degenerate man sitting in the white house under the control and influence of russian president vladimir vladimirovich putin is a clear and present danger to the preservation, protection and defense of our constitutional way of life. rather than a thin spectral haunting we have a monstrous mad big malign macho male russian bear treating every american institution like a salmon run feeding frenzy preferentially eating the brains and gonads of uncle sam. <br/><br/>lying involves active deception and active failure to disclose information. not knowing the contents of donald trump's personal and corporate income tax returns and his personal and corporate business holdings, records and deals provides more than the appearance of impropriety. hiding this information from the american people plus a love of all things putin and russian risks a reasonable inference that donald trump is the siberian president due to greatest espionage coup in american history. putin is a synonym for kgb, gru, fsb, ussr and czar. <S_SEP> i also found trump's public plea to russia to release 30,000 of hillary's emails to be suspect. <br/><br/>since trump has been in office he has continually tried to undermine the reputation of intel agencies. he then makes an outrageous claim that obama tapped his phones. in the same week, we get the wikileaks about the technology that the intel agencies use. either i am paranoid, or this is part of a systematic attempt to undermine the intel agencies because they have trump's number. they are getting close. <S_SEP> as the editorial says, trump certainly doth protest to much, too often, and too loudly. and, if trump were innocent, wouldn't he want to clear the air with an independent investigation that would surely exonerate him?<br/><br/>actually, trump's defends himself largely by attacking and discrediting those who want an investigation, rather than demonstrating there is nothing to the accusations against him and the many campaign aides already identified as connecting with russia before and during the election. there is plenty of smoke here: russian oligarchs, russian loans, trump deals with russians. <br/><br/>the public has a right to know if trump and his campaign aides and presidential appointees colluded with the russians--especially given that the russian hackers meddled in our election process by hacking the dnc but not the rnc. what does that say?<br/><br/>an independent investigation is absolutely essential--especially since the republicans <br/><br/>can spend $80 million taxpayer dollars on all those clinton investigations while bill was in office (<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/allpolitics/stories/1999/04/01/counsel.probe.costs/" title="http://edition.cnn.com/allpolitics/stories/1999/04/01/counsel.probe.costs/" target="_blank">http://edition.cnn.com/allpolitics/stories/1999/04/01/counsel.probe.costs/</a> ), <br/><br/>and another $30 million taxpayer dollars on gop on investigations of hillary clinton and benghazi and on her emails (<a href="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/07/05/investigating-clinton-how-many-" title="http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/07/05/investigating-clinton-how-many-" target="_blank">http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2016/07/05/investigating-clinton-how-many-</a>....<br/><br/>the more they balk, the more we need to ask exactly what are trump and the republicans afraid of? <S_SEP> what the white house alleges is that federal agencies conducted a cyber surveillance of trump advisors—not trump himself—and found no evidence of collusion with russian operatives. in today’s new york times, nicholas kristof provides evidence that the fbi snooping occurred. in an opinion piece in today’s titled “connect trump’s dots to russia,” kristof’s provides a link to an october 2016 new york times article that states fbi agents “scrutinized advisers close to donald j. trump, looking for financial connections with russian financial figures.” kristof’s says this cyber surveillance revealed “unexplained communications between a trump organization computer server and russia’s alfa bank.” however, the october article is headlined: “investigating donald trump, f.b.i. sees no clear link to russia.” <S_SEP> i see a lot of putin apologists and trump supporters on facebook who are in denial about the trump-russia connection and claim that there is some sort of "hysteria" about this subject among democrats. let us instead return to the world of facts, and stop indulging in pleasant delusions that may not correspond to reality. kristof ably summarizes aspects of the issue that congress and the federal government should be investigating on an urgent basis. my take: where there's smoke, there's fire. <S_SEP> you've missed a crucial dot, nick. the steele dossier alleged that russia made trump campaign aid carter page an offer in which, if trump won the presidency and lifted us sanctions on russia, he and his associates would be granted 19% stake in russia's state-run oil company, rosneft. on december 7, after the election, 19.5% of rosneft was sold to private entities. on december 8, carter page was back in moscow.<br/><br/>this is not conclusive, i realize, as we all should. but it speaks to the possibility that what was at stake here was not merely collusion on the campaign, but bribery of a massive scale. the difference between these two crimes, to my mind, is that the republicans will always be able to make the argument that russian interference didn't actually change the outcome of the election. they will not be able, if these allegations from the dossier prove true, to argue that russian interference didn't actually change policy. which is to say, more simply, they will have no answer to the accusation that trump is unambiguously, monetarily, in putin's pocket. <S_SEP> thank you mr. kristof for pointing out potential connections between the trump administration and the russian government in rationale way without the over the top claims often seen in other opinion pieces on this subject.<br/>we do deserve a complete and impartial investigation of these issues and if there was no collusion then the president and his cabinet and staff and the country can move on to other important issues that face the country. if we learn that trump associates or trump were involved in activities that violate ethical or legal standards we can demand resignations of those involved and criminal prosecution if the actions were criminal or if false statements under oath were given by witnesses.<br/>until an investigation is completed, the ranting and outlandish statements from both sides of this issue are not helpful and in my opinion are destructive to our democracy. i have told my liberal and conservative friends that just because you believe it, or want it to be true, does not mean that it is true.<br/>we need a complete and unbiased investigation, to the extent that is possible, and we also need to tone down the nasty rhetoric, starting with mr. trump himself and the members of congress. <S_SEP> , russia and donald trump "be careful: democrats should avoid descending into the kind of conspiratorial mind-set that led some republicans to assume hillary clinton was a criminal..."<br/>"russia made compromising videos of trump in 2013..."<br/>"trump has expressed a bewilderingly benign view of russia and appointed officials also friendly to moscow."<br/><br/>let's look at these statements from your article. first, you tell us not to see conspiracies around every corner. then you tell us russia has compromising videos of trump. i find it hard to believe that there could be any such thing as a compromising video of donald trump. he won the election despite telling his supporters that he could shoot someone in the middle of fifth avenue and not lose a vote. the infamous billy bush tape was made when melania was pregnant with his son. there is no video that could compromise his reputation because it is already in the gutter. why people would vote for a man like that is not relevant to whether there was a conspiracy between his campaign and russia to defeat hillary clinton. finally your allegation that he has taken a benign attitude towards russia has a plausibly innocent explanation. he is trying for a russian reset, just as bush and obama did before him. remember bush's statement about looking into putin's eyes and seeing a good man?<br/><br/>i believe at this point you don't have many dots to connect and you are looking for conspiracies behind every corner. <S_SEP> the issue isn't so much russia interfering in our election, the united states isn't exactly innocent of doing the same thing in other countries, it's whether or not the current president colluded with russia. for those of us who were paying attention trump actually publicly sent a request to the russians to find hillary's lost emails. shortly thereafter wikileaks began leaking emails that were damaging to the clinton campaign.<br/><br/>one can argue that he was being flippant and isn't responsible for the leaked emails. but we need to find out if his engagement with the russians went farther than that. considering how many people in his cabinet who have already come under fire for their own actions with russia, things aren't looking good for trump's innocence in this matter.<br/><br/>if sessions is smart he will have an independent prosecutor handle the investigation. once the fbi concludes their investigation republicans need to ensure that they are transparent about the findings. how they handle this situation is going to determine how the next generation views the republican party. <br/><br/>the republicans put country before party with nixon. a lot of people went to jail. but because of how they handled the situation they won 3 straight elections after carter's loss to reagan. <S_SEP> trump has continuously denied ever being in contact with russia, which is a blatant lie. the closer congress gets to an investigation, the more he deflects such as obama wiretaps. trump is getting desperate. his deflections are getting more absurdist. any credibility he had is gone, and now it's inimical to the nation because he cannot govern until this investigation ends. the man is a pathological liar. but the proverbial pandora's box is open. trump can run, but he can't hide, <S_SEP> there is something definitely very dodgy about donald trump's ambiguous relationship with russia. i think that your evocation of trump's hysterical self-defence is the key behind a tremendous scheme of complicity behind trump's operators and the kremlin. the general public is already aware of trump's salacious side -- it has to be something far more serious than a banal honeypot set-up which doesn't shock anyone anymore. let us just hope that he does not decide to take everyone down with him in flames in the event darker truths emerge. <S_SEP> it appears donald trump is strongly motivated by his personal financial interest and the financial interests of his family. it appears his lack of discipline has caused him to enter bankruptcy a number of times, making him a poor credit risk to western bankers. it appears the russians have come to his aid, and several of his projects sold to primarily russian investors. the question becomes who really owns him and what has he and his family been promised for playing along with his owners. i hope i am wrong, but if the republican led congress has no interest in pursuing these very serious issues, it is reasonable to suspect they know it is very serious and if uncovered could jeopardized their promised tax cuts for the top 1% and dismantling of regulations (that is, protections for the average citizens). i sincerely hope the press keeps the pressure on so the russian connection can be cleared up one way or another. <S_SEP> one matter that weighs heavily in the analysis is that, with all of the evidence of contacts, the russians appear only to have disclosed clinton emails. which they were already doing without any help from the trump team. there is no evidence that, with all the contacts, the trump team contributed anything to the russian effort. surely, that suggests that they were discussing maters unrelated to election tampering. moreover, election tampering is straight out treason. why would the trump team take the risk of all to prison for life when they apparently had nothing to contribute to the russian effort. <S_SEP> my explanation of putin's actions:<br/>it may be in the russian policy manuals that whenever there is a chance to hurt an adversary without risk it should be done. the internet seems well suited for such an action. it may not have any additional ulterior motive and may simply be opportunism.<br/>it may be in russia's interest that the weakest presidential candidate is elected. and just as in chess, when you can confuse and weaken your opponent, you do it: so putin has been very successful indeed, given all the mayhem around trump's election.<br/>here in europe many are extremely suspicious of putin's motives. maybe his actions will quickly be forgotten in the us, but not here.<br/><br/>some good that may come out of this election: awareness of<br/>(1) the vulnerability of society to false, or even true but highly disruptive, information spread by the internet.<br/>(2) the large distance between men and women in society.<br/>(3) the large psychological distance between the upper and lower classes, who give hardly any attention to each other.<br/>(4) the large extent to which europe, and its elites, lean on the us.<br/>(5) the fundamental expansionistic attitude of russia, contrary to all treaties and promises. <S_SEP> , russia and trump, intelligence community, leak of conversation do not agree with your assessment.<br/>the most obvious russia theory is the money tie. he was heavily vested in russia in 2008. if they loaned to him then in a horrible housing market and got paid back i'm sure they loaned to him more recently.<br/><br/>second, trump is not a fool. if you will recall his presidency began with serious questions from democrats about his influencing the election. he made so much unsubstantiated noise about the election being rigged against him that everyone gave up the other argument. scary effective!<br/><br/>lastly, i don't want an investigation into the michael flynn russia conversations. if you open that up you also open up how and why the intelligence community leaked the conversation in the first place. had they not we wouldn't have even known. an investigation might very well silence an organization that right now is placing a much needed check on our president's power. <S_SEP> the burden of proof is on trump to show that his ties to russia is not based on economic / business ties that override national interests. as pointed out, mr. trump can answer this concern by releasing his tax returns that he has not been willing to do to date. <br/><br/>if there is a political conspiracy , i believe mr. trump will be ousted, as he should be. this why we need a special committee to investigate this possibility to ensure an impartial examination of the evidence. the sooner the better. <S_SEP> "yet i wouldn’t be surprised if the trump team engaged in secret contacts and surreptitious messages, and had advance knowledge of russia’s efforts to attack the american political process. and that would be a momentous scandal."<br/><br/>that should be a momentous scandal. but in today's looking glass world, events that would have ground the news cycle to a halt a generation ago barely rate an acknowledgement. phony stories floated by the alt right masquerade as legitimate lines of inquiry, dulling the impact of the truth. the public becomes fatigued to the point of numbness from constant alarms, which creates a higher tolerance for trump's outrageous behaviour. the only lifeline we have is a persistent, honest press. mr. kristof, thank you for relentlessly keeping the focus on vital issues. <S_SEP> "one reason i’m increasingly suspicious is trump’s furious denunciations of the press and of barack obama, to the point that he sometimes seems unhinged. journalists have learned that when a leader goes berserk and unleashes tirades and threats at investigators, that’s when you’re getting close."<br/><br/> i worked for many years for a bully and general all-around jerk. i learned very early on to watch for the moment when he started yelling and confronting, because that meant that whoever had spoken, includingi, was getting close to the truth. i never told him that i'd figured him out, because waiting for him to aggress became a handy way of seeing through his deceptions. i would just try this or that until he started shouting. then i knew.<br/><br/>trump reminded me from the start of this of noxious boss – although the boss was a lot smarter than trump – and i wait for him to freak out to determine whether the media is on the right track. the media should keep chasing the russian connection, because the evidence is there to be found. i agree with nick that there was no express quid pro quo, but think that whatever happened, at least via trump's aides, came very close to that. <S_SEP> of the twin issues, the foreign incursion into the election process, foreshadowed by implicit references before the data was spilled directly and through cutouts, augmented by a deliberate pattern of russians, including the russian ambassador, seeking contact with key advisers to donald trump, and the continuing denials and distancing of the administration from these officials (too little, too late) is more urgent and consequential than the gop committee members focus on leaks. <br/><br/>agreed, government officials should not leak or surveil us citizens without cause, but the issue of a foreign government deliberately engaging in a sustained two-pronged attack through cyber theft/data mining and personal contacts is of a greater magnitude and far more dangerous. <br/><br/>the insidiousness of cyber-attacks is that they spill no blood; they seem passive; they minimize fear. but they are more powerful than bombs. the threat level is greater than terrorist chatter--it's time to go to defcon 2.<br/><br/>the new administration, focused on its reputation, is obscuring the full exposure of the threat and underplaying its seriousness. trump is putting his narrative of glory and vanity above the nation's security, even as he looks in the wrong direction for threats. his obsessions, blindness, lies, indifference, and stubbornness amplify threats he tries to minimize.<br/><br/>government officials engaged in leaks, while others, it appears, were engaged in a cover-up. gen. flynn's activity points to this. <S_SEP> mr. kristof’s very first point, “president trump and his aides have repeatedly and falsely denied ties to russia. usa today counted at least 20 denials. in fact, we now know that there were contacts by at least a half-dozen people in the trump circle with senior russian officials” does not mention that except for jared kushner’s contact that was voluntarily disclosed by the white house, the others were acknowledged only after a diligent media had exposed them. <br/><br/>so what is the trump administration covering up? if there is no “there” there, then why all the flailing and protesting? trump’s tax returns would go a long way to proving this russia connection is much ado about nothing, but the white house resists. it seems like only a special prosecutor with subpoena power can establish how deep moscow has landed on the potomac? <S_SEP> , russia and usa yes, trump is seeming more unhinged these days so maybe the net is getting closer to snagging the traitors. more telling to me, however, is the recent wikileaks dump of cia hacking tools. the russians are sending a warning and that is an indication that they are feeling the heat as well. i just hope our intelligence services are up to the challenge. <S_SEP> "appointing an independent prosecutor, who would not take orders from the administration."<br/> absolutely, it is time for the american public to know the truth. an independent special prosecutor would be the better route toward separating truth from conspiracy. if trump has confidence in his claims that there was no russian interference in the election , he should not have any objection to that. a special prosecutor or an independent commission should investigate russia's attempt to influence the election in favor of trump — without being distracted by the president's tweets.to find facts about the russian role in the 2016 election, congressional leaders should name a select, watergate-style committee of highly respected members from both parties and perhaps from both chambers. any evidence of criminal wrongdoing would be referred to the justice department, <S_SEP> better yet, he will come up with the clear picture of trumpco colluding with the russian government to undermine the democratic process and steal the election from hillary clinton. i just don'r understand people like you. yo want to lock hillary clinton up for some e-mails, yet you don't want to know the truth about the trump russia connection. <S_SEP> trump has been known to stretch the limits of "truthiness". when a person makes outrageous comments and takes liberties with the facts it is very difficult to take anything they say with any surety. <br/><br/>he has a reputation as a shrewd business man and for stiffing the people he does business with hence he has made his own bed when trying to convince many of us that he is truthful.<br/>there is more to the russia story and possibly many others issues in trumps past. the russian connection need to be fully investigated, to sweep in under the carpet only subverts getting to the truth. <br/><br/>trump has never done anything in his life to serve the public good if anyone has evidence of that please tell us about it. it is imperative that we must rely on the patriots serving in government and in the free press to uncover the "dirty deeds" committed by the trump administration now and in the future. something stinks about this russia business and it's not the swedish fish. <S_SEP> the problem with trump (among dozens and dozens of other issues), is that he does not, under any circumstances want to be the transparent president. so long as he can prevent the american people from seeing in black and white (i.e. tax returns) that he/his organization definitively have (take your pick), (a), pending loans from russian interests, (b), past or pending "deals" with russian interests, (c), assorted documented business dealings with russian and other foreign interests which will prove @potus has lied to the voters, including his red hat wearing base, and that his life is a house of lies. bring on the totally independent investigation of his business interests as part of the djt-russian connection and (a), you'll have a dandy movie script, and, (b), we will all see this sociopathic liar and ego maniac for who he is. <S_SEP> i am looking forward to an investigation. without question, there are rats scattering from the current administration and the past administration. both sides will suffer.<br/>i remind everyone that no evidence has been presented to date...none! i also remind everyone that the intent of russia was to disrupt, and cause chaos. mission accomplished. they don't give a hoot about trump or clinton.<br/>the russians are well aware the american media is like a dog with a bone...throw the bone anywhere, and the american media will chase said bone, and half the country (gop and dems) will buy their stories hook, line and sinker. <S_SEP> the ny times editorial board is risking its own credibility with this continual harping, continual beating of a dead horse.<br/>it seems obvious to even some of the most naive observers;<br/>1. there's a lot of spying going on. russia spies on us. us spies on russia. ivory coast spies on hillary. hillary spies on haiti. britian, yes, britain almost certainly spies on us, israel, etc.....as israel is spying on everyone too.....and the old movie is correct!! "the president's analyst" set forth the correct theory that the telephone company controls everything!!<br/>2. it stretches the limits of believability when the fbi asserts that it "investigated itself" and found "no evidence of wiretapping"....c'mon now. oh wait, now comey admits they were indeed wiretapping trump tower, but only because there was "criminal russian activity in room 63_a" yeah right, good one.<br/>3. the political partisanship over a nonsense issue is destroying america far worse than the liberal nightmare of "pres trump"....all for a short-sighted, selfish goal of power.<br/>drop the investigation now. its pointless............... <S_SEP> , dt so just because dt doesn't have a set of nesting dolls in the oval office that proves he is not a russophile? the russians would conceivable have begun to destabilize clinton's campaign regardless of who the gop nominee would have been, so your point about when the hacking began does not hold water. we do know that the most important thing in the world to trump is his brand, his business, making money, so yes it is quite conceivable that trump would sell out u.s. interests if it improved his bottom line. <S_SEP> republicans and democrats alike can agree unanimously that trump cares more about russia than the u.s. i would disagree with the author of this piece, however, that the idea that russia has compromising material on trump is unlikely. i think it's the most plausible theory. my guess is that it's something way worse than simply hookers peeing on beds. an investigation into trump's treason is necessary. <S_SEP> , putin's relation to usa, russians in government we we do not have to connect the dots. it is very clear that putin is our king maker. russian collusion is crystal clear. all on a sudden reagan's republican party has become a pro moscow party. now republican party has 36 percent pro russian supporters. kgb moles are planted in our politics and government extensively. our potus has greatest respect for the thug putin as a great strong leader. if money transactions involved between russia and trump campaign, then it should be investigated vigorously. <S_SEP> someone needs to come up with the courage to speak the unspeakable: if the people who are in a position to investigate the legitimacy of the election are those who benefit from the white house being in republican hands, then the investigation itself will forever remain suspect, as will the legitimacy of the executive branch. we need to include clinton supporters in the dialogue, and include them in the investigation. we need to accept the possibility that the election could have been compromised. <br/><br/>this is simple logic. if there was illegal collusion between the campaign and russian operatives, it taints not only trump, but pence as well. it taints the entire election. it's troubling that those who are entrusted with the question of what comes next, seem to first insist that we "accept the results of the election" before we address whether the election was compromised. <br/><br/>shouldn't it be the other way around?<br/><br/>disparaging voters as "sore losers" does nothing to quell the concerns of the majority of voters who did not choose a republican administration. if the clinton campaign was hobbled by unrelenting russian interference, we voters were robbed of our right to a fair election. rewarding the rnc amounts to an ironclad guarantee that the same thing will happen next time. <S_SEP> , government handling of the election there is no polite way around it: the american voters were betrayed by their government during the 2016 presidential campaign. no reasonable, objective observer can now conclude that the 2016 election was fair and legitimate.<br/><br/>as director comey revealed yesterday to the shock of the intelligence committee, the trump-russia investigation actually began last july! yet this critical and potentially disqualifying information on donald trump was deliberately withheld from the voting public throughout the entire fall campaign.<br/><br/>meanwhile at the same time, every little tidbit of negative information on hillary clinton was being indiscriminately leaked to (by the russian cutout, wikileaks, and by rogue fbi agents in new york!) and gleefully reported by the press in their goal of having a competitive horse race.<br/><br/>in short, the american voters were denied the critical information they needed in order to make an informed decision in the presidential election.<br/><br/>given this new disclosure, there is no question that this was not a fair and representative election.<br/><br/>if this had been a jury proceeding, any competent judge would have thrown out the verdict and declared a mistrial.<br/><br/>yesterday was indeed a dark day for representative democracy. <S_SEP> , trump's policies my bet is that is that the russians have been doing whatever they can to alter election outcome(s) the same as the usa (cia) has been doing for decades. ask the good people of; argentian, guatemala, the list is endless.<br/>putin did not want clinton as president because she would have started a hot war and upset his thiefdom.<br/>trump on the other hand, is in the bag and up to his neck in debt with russian oligarchs. also, putin knew that trump would ruin this country with policies that would send the usa back to the 20 th century. so far trump has a cabinet of "useful idiots" doing what putin hope for. including spending more money on the military when the usa's infrastructure is falling apart. my bet is that we will see a major bridge collapse killing many soon.<br/>in the meantime, the cia have been caught with their pants down.<br/>putin is playing chess and winning. <S_SEP> this is really the key, isn't it? "if mr. trump’s assertion that there was no collusion between his campaign officials and the russian government is true, he should want this matter to be fully investigated as quickly and as transparently as possible." dt's (and his subordinates' and close supporters') dismissive, even insulting responses to the investigation only raise further suspicion. <S_SEP> the trouble with most of the hand-wringing about trump's russia connection is that it approaches the matter from the wrong perspective. we are witnessing something never before seen in our civic and political history. rather than assuming innocence on his part and wondering where these scraps of evidence might lead, investigators must act from the viewpoint that he and many of his cronies are guilty of the worst offenses, which would include an ongoing collaboration with the russians. then see if any evidence surfaces that disproves that viewpoint. i am convinced the man is at best compromised, at worst a committed stooge of putin, and pray that i'm wrong. <S_SEP> it seems that there is a collective amnesia that (as reported by the nyt and the ft) all of the principal russians responsible for the dnc hacking have been arrested as cia spies. mr leonhard, as long as you don't account for this we will never understand the hacking and its motive and an investigation would be just a whitewash. was this a cia operation or a kremlin job?or both?<br/>also, according to an investigative series in the ft, trump's deepest soviet block business connection is with kazakhstan. kazakh dirty money built trump soho after the banks turned trump down. <S_SEP> , gop committee members, russian connection methinks the culprit-in-chief doth protest too much. via tweet, of course, his substitute for a pacifyer. how curious but not surprising that the primary concern for the gop committee members investigating the russian connection should focus on the leaks of information, rather than the possible collusion of trump campaign members and trump himself with throwing a national election. cya, as we used to say in the army. yesterday sen. "upchuck" grassley went so far as to equate the two violations, even though one would be punished by several thousand dollars' fine and/or 3-5 years in jail; the latter by possible execution as a traitor to the us. how low can these gop hacks go? grassley, ironically, chairs the judiciary committee. <S_SEP> all of the american people, republicans, democrats and independents have lost a significant amount of trust in the current administration. it is also alarming that many of our closest allies have become wary of our government's integrity. if i were a republican congressional representative or senator, i would be insisting that an independent special prosecutor be appointed to investigate the relationships between the trump camp and the russian government. what are they waiting for? if an independent special prosecutor is not appointed many republican representatives and senators are placing themselves in a perilous position in the 2018 election. comey and rodgers are to be respected for their integrity and focus. but, they can not control president trump. frankly, no one can control this irresponsible, dishonest leader. tweeting about "fake news" as mr. comey was testifying that the fbi and the department of justice has no reason to believe that president obama wiretapped donald trump is more than embarrassing, it is reprehensible. wake up america... <S_SEP> so the democrats here have two divergent logic streams. they have no evidence of any russian involvement that changed the outcome of the election but they submit that is fine--no need for evidence because they believe it is true. the converse logic stream is that unless president trump has iron clad evidence of wiretapping then it cannot be true. the whole idea of spying is not to leave any evidence that you were there. it took more than six months for the donna brazile narrative that the democrats kept pushing that donna did not feed the questions to clinton to unravel. another six months and the democrats might have another meal of crow to eat. <S_SEP> the only thing nick forgets to mention -- the only "dot" on the 2016 radar that proves the will of the people was subverted -- the dems throwing the nomination to hillary. it's not just bernie, the dems actively supported the clinton nomination and actively discouraged any others who might want to run. then they undermined bernie's candidacy. <br/><br/>if the readers want a political scandal, there it is. but instead, all the times has time for is chasing the chimera of trump-russian collusion in "stealing" the election -- a complete fabulation of nonevents (dots) and imaginary lines. the election wasn't stolen, it's questionable as to whether the russian government hacked and a complete distortion -- fake news as it were -- that the trump campaign colluded.<br/><br/>but keep it up nick -- i'm sure carlos slim will put something nice in your stocking for christmas. <S_SEP> what has bewildered me throughout the election cycle and now early in the new administration is how scandal just bounces off our new president. he doesn't seem to care or acknowledge truths that would skewer any other elected official. his response to proven russian collusion will likely be "so what?, i won". <S_SEP> , russia and election i am amazed that the trump campaign (proving we are in now the never ending form of such) has not bought ads to put out the other big statement clapper made last sunday, which was: no evidence of collusion between trump and putin was found.<br/><br/>that sound bite is the perfect "proof" that the msm picks and chooses to make fake news.<br/><br/>the dots biz, and the call for a "special prosecutor", is really a means by the people way out of power to get a white water style fishing license. but the clinton special prosecutor happened because one party controlled the hill and wanted to undercut the white house. that is not the chess board now.<br/><br/>the folk that want to play this game know that trump can never prove the negative.<br/><br/>as far as the truth about 16? clear enough... foreign (and domestic) intelligence did try to put a heavy thumb on the scales to "influence" the election. they did so by being the still working contacts inside that the mi6 "emeritus" kristof cites that tried to run an old cold war story. and the effort to turn every russian with any contact into a boris or natasha kgb agent since is more ridiculous than the "dossier" the american voters tossed on the trash heap.<br/><br/>as far as kompromat, i'd worry more about the in watched watchers who can turn on any congressperson's telly. a lot of orwell style black mail there (indeed, why doesn't the times explore the reason that the "groping" tape survived/existed, which has the smell of tv executives fearing law suit type kompromat)
director comey said yesterday that the fbi doesn't want to release information on ongoing investigations unless it is the public interest to do so. which explains why he felt the need to reveal the newly discovered hilary clinton emails on anthony weiner's server just days before the election. but then, why didn't he reveal the ongoing investigations involving the connections between russia and the trump campaign aides back in july 2016? was it not also in the public interest to be informed? <S_SEP> , clinton email affair, comey's statement i watched nearly the entire hearing and kept waiting for the clinton email revelation to be mentioned somewhere along the way. i don't understand how comey could say over and over that he could not reveal this or that during an ongoing investigation when he violated that very rule himself in a huge way back in october. <S_SEP> given comeys bringing up hillary's emails 9 days pre election when there was nothing new but failed to see why we should know about trumps connections with russia...the fbi did work for the republicans over the democrats. <S_SEP> the fact that comey is still fbi director is an outrage in itself. <S_SEP> over due for an independent special prosecutor...comey is beholden to trump for his job, and after his misstep of thrusting the fake email news that threw the election, he is not the one to take this home. a full legitimate independent investigation, nothing less. <S_SEP> , extradition request, partisanship of usa and russia we may never find out more about trump's russia motives as we now have an ultra partisan jeff sessions as the attorney general and an fbi director who wouldn't "confirm or deny a pending investigation" about trump's russia connections but was all too willing to blabber about fbi's review of clinton's email, which most likely cost clinton the election. <br/><br/>how partisan jeff sessions is will be evident today as the us justice department is supposed to be in a vienna courtroom today regarding its extradition request in a case involving ukraine. see news story, "will trump rescue the oligarch in the gilded cage?" <a href="http://tinyurl.com/gw5kue2" title="http://tinyurl.com/gw5kue2" target="_blank">http://tinyurl.com/gw5kue2</a> <S_SEP> , leakers of classified information "while there has been a growing body of circumstantial evidence of such links..."<br/><br/>like what? a trump staffer once passed a man russian down the street?<br/>former heads of both the cia and the nsa say they have seen the so-called evidence and have declared there is nothing there. of course comey is going to investigate anyway, that is his job. let's investigate the leakers of classified information to the ny times. let's see if we can't send a few ex-obamaites and maybe a few reporters to guantanamo bay for a nice long visit. <S_SEP> we wager that trump will fire comey soon now that the director has leaked information about an ongoing investigation to congress. the "president" has already outsourced the fbi investigations to breitbart and to talking heads on fox news. <S_SEP> actually if one investigates all the outlets reporting on this instead of simply accepting, ovine-like, the thrust this poitical party organ advances, interesting facts emerge. first off, no electoral "process" was interfered with, hacked or had otherwise been victim to tampering. even this paper has had to report that, buried deep in columns as it is. the dnc and some of its minions were indeed exposed - for the liars, cheats, hypocrites and in more than a few cases, petty little micro-minds, that they are. more importantly, while the reds hacked the dnc, our nsa was hacking the reds. so everything they have on the clintons - which has not been released - is also in the hands of the nsa. as usual for the left, they clamor for a public expose of this not considering the damage to their intent. a public investigation will of course out all the clinton 30,000 emails detailing their money laundering, their graft and yes, their contacts with foreign governments. won't that be a hoot. of course it will completely blunt the left's intended weapon, as is their hilariously repetitive wont. the clown caucus continues. <S_SEP> "these brazen warning shots from the president do enormous damage to public confidence in the f.b.i.’s investigation." on the contrary, i'd say they increase the public's confidence in the fbi's investigation. let's just hope they get on the investigation before president tweeter fires mr. comey! <S_SEP> how many times did hillary and her staff bump into russians? how many times did obama and his staff bump into russians? how come no one is asking theses questions? how many times does government officials bump into russians in dc or other cities? is this a crime to be investigated? perhaps the russians were trying to influence the election in favor of hillary and obama? <S_SEP> , russians and trump all good points. there are simply too many ties between the trump people and russian contacts. trump's finances are too murky. his unprecedented refusal to release his tax returns shows he is hiding something major. and his increasingly bizarre over the top conspiracy claims about pres. obama, the media and the intelligence community are either a descent into paranoia madness or a desperate attempt to preempt investigative findings.<br/><br/>there are obviously many ugly if not illegal actions hidden under the various rocks. the republicans like nunes and sessions have already engaged in cover ups about this. an independent prosecutor is clearly needed. if russia has financial or other holds over the president of the united states, it is a clear and present danger. <S_SEP> tax returns are often the foundation of a legal investigation. why haven't any of the congressional committees or other law enforcement agencies that are investigating trump issuing subpoenas for the returns? why are the american people, and their elected officials, not clamoring for the disclosure of the returns? <S_SEP> , investigation, press, fbi chief, democrats comey's days at the fbi are probably numbered. if trump fires him that would insure an ineffective investigation by congress or the justice department. it is impossible to imagine this administration setting up a select committee. so it will be up to democrats to keep trying to push things forward, to the press to keep digging and to the dwindling number of public servants that still care about good government to keep leaking. <S_SEP> , ukraine affair comey admitted under oath that it was illegal...a felony...for anyone to leak any of the flynn information, yet, did not confirm an investigation into such leaks. <br/><br/>but, 6 months into an investigation into trump/russia ties, there is zero evidence. zero. <br/><br/>comey is way too coy. way too much of a politician. <S_SEP> there is no reason to doubt comey's commitment? was the editor living under a rock when the director called for a "reopening" of the bogus clinton email investigation a week before the election? an effort that no doubt swung the election in trump's favor. and now we learn that when he made that bombshell announcement, his agency was investigating trump's campaign, if not trump himself, for committing treason against the united states. i seem to recall another fbi director who vowed to "investigate the hell out of" the watergate burglary as he burned the evidence of white house involvement. democracy is in deep trouble indeed with the likes of comey, gowdy, et al investigating. <S_SEP> it is trumpgate. please don't pretend it is anything else. trump invited russian hacking of clinton and the whole world heard him do it. trumpgate is here. <S_SEP> perhaps one day we'll be able to look back at this extraordinary acknowledgment by the fbi director and recognize it as the beginning of the end for the trump presidency. our election was hijacked and our new president was there all along, cheering it on, in cahoots with those who hated hillary and our imperfect democracy. <S_SEP> why are comey's news so lacking in facts? <S_SEP> , irs i can't help but wonder - where was the cry for a special prosecutor when the irs was targeting conservative non-profit groups? or when if became clear that hillary's use of a private server was never authorized and, in fact, violated national security protocol? or when obama wiretapped reporters? not to change the subject - any dealings with russia before the election is chump change compared to this. <S_SEP> another potential dot, doesn't it seem suspiciously convenient that during the election, trump asked russia to hack and locate hillary's missing emails, considering what came to light about their hacking activities later? at the time it just seemed like part of his flamboyant showman's personality, but in retrospect it comes off cagey to me, like he was in the know. also, as a couple of other commenters have mentioned, the circumstances around the sale of that mansion in florida seem, at the very least, curious. given all these unanswered questions, it's appalling that many gop'ers seem to have no sense of urgency to scrutinize his tax returns. <S_SEP> "the fourth explanation is the flimsiest: the idea, contained in a dossier compiled by private investigators, that russia has compromising material on trump. unless real evidence emerges, i’d encourage you to ignore this theory."<br/><br/>i wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the dossier put together by a well-regarded british spy, parts of whose story are being slowly confirmed by reporters.<br/><br/>i respect the reportorial caution, but where there's smoke there could be a president who is fired. <S_SEP> do you sit by the fire with a glass of vodka for inspiration when you come up with these preposterous "motives"? are you smoking a pipe? if you are, i suggest filling it with tobacco instead of the stuff you're smoking. now, let me suggest another motive; entrenched bureaucrats in the intelligence community, fearing for their jobs, leak secret data, to gullible new york times reporters, in order to overturn an election and bring down a sitting president. why isn't there an investigation to find these people and bring them to justice? the only crimes committed so far are these illegal leaks. the only ideological conspiracy here is between the new york times and radical liberals that want to overthrow the government. <S_SEP> this "shocking risk to american interests" was covered up by the american government and the media before the election. the powers that be had a copy of the christopher steele dossier, and instead of getting to the bottom of it -- we still do not know what in it is true or false -- the government, and comey in particular, with the help of the media, obsessed about hrc's dumb and boring emails while covering up the dossier of trump's ties with russia. <br/><br/>that is truly outrageous. trump is an unhinged reality t.v. star. what excuse do the rest of you have? <S_SEP> , abraham l. comey how independent can comey be after selecting to release (non) information on clinton's emails days before the election and "burying the lede" on trump's connection to russia? <S_SEP> nor with trump's puppy dog james comey as fbi director. <S_SEP> an excellent column. more, please. people with a reason to be nervous have dismissed the dossier of christopher steele as politically-motivated (which it was) and unsupported by evidence, but the funny thing is that, as more information surfaces, the claims in this dossier turn out to be true. <br/><br/>mr. kristof is absolutely right: we need an open, public investigation along the lines of the 9/11 commission. anything short of that will be a disservice to the american people. <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair, fbi comey's acknowledgement of the investigation comes a few months too late. it should have come last year *before* the election.<br/><br/>the investigation supposedly began in july of last year and there was no announcement from the fbi director although he was all too willing to announce the tenuous connection into the clinton emails emanating from an investigation of anthony weiner well before that investigation was completed. <br/><br/>so much for all the focus on the "leaks" by the gop at the hearing. <br/><br/>as for the need for a special prosecutor, attorney general sessions and/or his deputy will do well to follow sally yates' answer to a question from then senator sessions on advising the president about improper or illegal actions. <br/><br/>“senator, i believe that the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the constitution, and to give their independent legal advice to the president.”<br/><br/>sally yates, of course, got fired for giving the president independent legal advice. <br/><br/>the question for sessions is whether he wants to be a profile in courage as sally yates was, or a profile in cowardice. <S_SEP> it's especially haunting because mr. comey virtually destroyed the democratic party's hopes of election, by coming out 11 days before voting day to talk breathlessly about an fbi investigation, while sitting on this trump-russia investigation all along.<br/>the fbi had been investigating trump-russia since july-- shortly after the gop convention, and 3 months before the presidential election.<br/>but were mute, and only spoke about 1 of 2 investigations that were ongoing.<br/>there's a tarnish that is not coming off the brass.<br/>and a mere 2 months into this administration, it's going to be a long road to hoe. worse than watergate. and a terrible situation for our democracy.<br/>stay outraged. <S_SEP> i still don't understand why comey released the clinton e-mail information on the cusp of the election. i cannot trust him entirely, no matter what he said in this committee inquiry. <br/><br/>that said, an independent prosecutor would be a great relief. <S_SEP> ever since buzzfeed made steele's dossier available, i have been studying it, inserting the memos in a timeline i was obliged to assemble, a timeline more detailed than any i have seen available in the media. actually, i feel kristof made a poor case for the trump-putin involvement. the dossier's memos are proving to be on the money, as have the assange wikileaks sabotaging clinton's campaign. i beleve that some of the media have the answers to the few remaining questions. we have been attacked and we are at war, make no mistake. <S_SEP> currently the people around trump are beginning to circle the wagons. first preibus on tv , fox news , stated he did not read the transcript of flynns conversation withe russian ambassador. intentionally insulating himself from the coming firestorm. like the question " what did you know and when didi you know it ?" corey lewandowski told david axelrod on cnn , that the buses containing illegal voters from mass. coming into new hampshire , as steve miller said was not true ( surprise surprise). but more important he said trump know nothing about contact with russians and if it was done it was probably manafort asking the russians for help. i think he was building a case to protect and insulate trump just as priebus is doing. <S_SEP> any accusations by the nyt's, fbi director, or former intelligence directors against comrade trump are merely fake news.<br/><br/> -vladimir, fearless leader <S_SEP> only one possibility explains why trump's tax returns have not been leaked. the irs does not have them.<br/>they were hacked, copied and the originals destroyed. putin may have them, waiting for the right time to release them. <br/><br/>it is past the irs at this point. <S_SEP> it's haunting alright. let's hope most of us are still alive when the investigations are finally over. wouldn't want to hurt anyone's feelngs. although it is hard to understand. comey cannot be fired, so what is he afraid of? <S_SEP> well stated, mr. leonhardt, but don't look to the congress or the fbi to conduct investigations that produce definitive answers. this moment, this issue, this person begs for the attention of determined well-resourced investigative journalists whose results will be shared in the open fora of public squares and academic halls, will demand the attention of the public and its officials, and will produce or result in accountability. <S_SEP> so, we now have the head of the fbi announcing that 1) the fbi is investigating the trump cabal for conspiring with a hostile foreign power to corrupt our presidential election, and 2) that trump lied when he accused obama of committing a felony.<br/><br/>and ryan and mcconnell are silent little rabbits, happy to ignore the slime they've embraced, using him as cover to push through their reactionary agenda that no one wants except the super rich.<br/><br/>they are worse than trump. <S_SEP> the investigation needs to begin with events prior to the election.<br/>the dossier identified many possible fraudulent <S_SEP> special outside prosecutor now.trump should not be able to comment simultaneously on an investigation of what could be treason against him and his revolting adm.this whole performance since the day he announced his candidacy has been appalling and embarrassing for our country.now oily rex has cancelled a nato meeting to go to russia???are you kidding me?this investigation should be done in private and the results not made public til the conclusion <S_SEP> , russia and trump's russian connections comey knew an investigation into trump's russian connections were ongoing during the same time he claimed to be investigating clinton's server and kept mum about that the much larger issue. had comey followed custom and been equally silent on both of his agency's investigations, i believe we would not have the democracy-ending, prevaricating disaster that is in the white house. why did comey inject himself into the campaign in the first place? rudolph guiliani tipped us off it was coming on television. therefore, who's going to investigate comey for leaking about another inquest into hillary email server, against the letter of the law, but not all that uncommon, versus ignoring the specter of a modern-day manchurian candidate? his meddling should have at least been even handed.<br/><br/>that's why i say: comey knew; comey coup. <S_SEP> one party and its supporters see an fbi investigation as a "no smoke without fire" thing - special prosecutor needed! the other party and their supporters sees said investigation as a distraction, after all there is no evidence of actual wrong doing. who is who? depends on the month it seems.
the correct answer to this nefarious multiple-choice question could well be f: all of the above. <br/><br/>mr. leonhardt acknowledges that the five options are not mutually exclusive, but he fails to thoroughly connect the dots between them. as another commenter has suggested, putin may well be trump's "role model"; accept that premise, and a and e necessarily follow. and b, c, and d may all be natural outgrowths of the business relationships with the wealthy and powerful in russia that trump has quite clearly spent decades cultivating -- if he owes russian oligarchs money, he and/or moscow may well have leveraged these relationships to torpedo hillary clinton's candidacy (an outcome to their mutual benefit), and at some point along the line russian intelligence compiled kompromat on trump to be used as needed.<br/><br/>to me, the russian connection is the one overarching concern that trumps every other trumpian scandal to date, because it prompts a deadly serious question -- is the seat of executive power in the united states under the sway of a hostile foreign power? has the white house become a mere satellite of the kremlin? if the answer is yes, then our very sovereignty as a nation becomes thrown into doubt. <S_SEP> , russia and trump mrs, i didn't like trump from the get-go, for a lot of reasons. but i have made a good-faith effort to filter out all the other stuff (the infamous 'p*ssy' tape, his more extraordinary lies, etc) and look at this particular question of russian involvement dispassionately.<br/>trump has been interested in russian for business reasons going back to the late 1990s. trump has stacked his administration with others who have financial ties or possible financial ties to the kremlin (flynn, manafort, carter page, etc). as leonhardt points out, there's a lot about trump's business empire we don't know, but we do know he still owns it and that he has mixed his presidential business with his family business since winning the election. putin sits at the top of russia's kleptocracy and can funnel billions wherever he likes. somebody clearly sabotaged clinton's campaign with the leaks, and the fbi is sure it was the russians. the russians have monkeyed around with elections before. the russians want to diminish the influence of the us-nato axis. the russians want the sanctions lifted.<br/>by themselves, these facts don't definitively prove corruption and/or coordination between trump and the russians to derail hillary's campaign. but taken together, is it so unreasonable to be suspicious and to demand further inquiry? <S_SEP> trump's fascination with russia is understandable. first, the dude is a developer always in need of cash. russian oligarchs have that. second, russians know no fear, thuggery is an art form. trump admires that. third, oh my god are russians intelligent! unbelievable. <br/><br/>putin is a role model. russia reflects what toughness can accomplish. putin fixed a broken country. he enriched his friends and is popular at the same time. russia no longer has a chechen problem, and has a mediterranean port. we have a middle east problem, and arab allies who are funding people trying to kill us. <br/><br/>trump admires the toughness spelled by russians and putin. he is emulating them. businesses from round the world are currying his favor, giving his family money. his is destroying the press and free speech. dangerous thugs and white nationalists are in charge of the white house and occupy cabinet positions. his party is in majority, scared witless of him, and cloying - largely because they are first cousins of white nationalism. he could, as he bragged once, terminate someone on 5th ave on live tv, and his sycophants will offer alternative facts. he has convinced voters they should join him in destroying america and enriching his friends. they are giddy, intoxicated, and hysterical. <br/><br/>quite like what putin has accomplished. <br/><br/>the trump-putin alliance will have the whole world quaking. it is an outcome both want very much. this is a very smart guy at work. <br/><br/>kalidan <S_SEP> consider combinations of motives: trump owes money, russia has kompromat, trump hasn't divested, exxon and other deals affect stock prices, his kids are his advisors. and there are personal relationships with russians and others. and think of the possibilities outside of russia. think even of the domestic possibilities for personal profit via: military spending, the border, sped-up drug approvals, and so forth. you don't have to be a graduate of trump university to see where this is going. he could actually leave office worth as much as he claimed when he got elected.<br/><br/>maybe he hasn't made a phone call to russia in years. or maybe he just pretended to be someone else when he did. so what? follow the money. <S_SEP> ok, since we are opining as to trump's motives: here is mine.<br/><br/>you put the political and the financial argument together, and you probably have it. trump was left for dead after the four bankruptcies. he was toxic; nobody would touch him. he was quoted as saying a homeless man on the street had more than he had. <br/><br/>so, how does someone emerge from that, raising capital in a very capital intensive industry? who would touch somebody like that with probably no equity, even less credit, and a reputation for screwing people even if we believe that some of the money comes from trademarking deals, it just does not all add up. <br/><br/>enter the russian (and chinese) money, but that $ comes with strings attached, which is where the political end of it arrives. my guess is that manafort and others were negotiating a peace deal in eastern europe in return for a) more laundered money for projects, and b) forgiveness of his loans in the event that putin gets both the crimea, and an option on the ukraine. heck, it is just another real estate deal, right?<br/><br/>trump could care less about doing president, but he does care about being president because, for now, it gives him leverage financially. he does care- no, is probably obsessed- with those loans because he has made his faustian bargain and is seeking a way out, which is probably why he behaves as he does. he will not refinance his loans conventionally (even if he could) because then the disclosures would come. dangerous game. <S_SEP> we know a lot of russian oligarchs have drained billions from the russian people and that they "invested" that money in the u.s. and around the world. we also know that donald and his son both said they did a lot of business with russians -- "a disproportionate amount." and we know that donald plays fast and loose with mafia figures and plays dirty with his own business partners, contractors and employees. he cheats them when he can.<br/><br/>this explains why donald, after a long life in global development, has no loyal friends. no one to name to ambassadorships and other government posts but family and generals and a few billionaires who have a stake in controlling regulation.<br/><br/>our conflict-in-chief is still in business. that is all he knows. <S_SEP> by all means, lets investigate his russian ties, but the real scandal here is the republican party's willingness to tolerate trump's attitudes towards putin, whatever their motive, and complete unsuitability and lack of qualifications for the office he holds. <S_SEP> i agree with your hypothesis that what'll probably come to light isn't likely to be clear and well defined deal. more likely to be russia offering information and help, and trump's team feeling like it'd be impolite to not respond - or being full of themselves feeling like spies but still doing things that are inconsequential.<br/><br/>that said, i think the real story is to be found in trump's finances. ryobovlev following him around during the campaign, and showing up at mar el lago the last three weekends for golf - that doesn't look so great. particularly since he bailed trump out with some well timed gifts of tens of millions of dollars. there'll be evidence of an inevitable bias towards those who've saved your bacon, not a criminal enterprise.<br/><br/>but i could be wrong. hope i'm not. <S_SEP> the question we will soon face is how much will we impugn trump for the actions of others, including those whom he hired and charged with winning a presidential election?<br/>it seems quite likley to me that we will find no direct involvement of the president, no quid pro quo agreement with the russians that has his actual fingerprints on it. he has benefitted clearly from russian interference and from the efforts of his subordinates to encourage that interference, but he continues to maintain a plausibly deniable distance from actual personal involvement (yes, he publicly invited the russians to hack the clinton campaign; but that was plausibly a joke and if we are being completely open-minded we have to give some credence to the argument that if he had actually been working secretly with the russians he would have hardly needed to ask them publicly...logic suggests quite the opposite).<br/>the fact is that trump's detached, fact-indifferent and cerebrally challenged approach to leadership increases the likelihood that he wouldn't have personnally had a clue as to how one would cut a deal with russains...he is simply that obtuse. manafort, flynn, sessions, et al are quite a different story, however. it is not just possible that they were offereng an explicit (or implicit) quid pro quo to the russians; it is increasingly likely.<br/>how, however, would one ever be able to turn that fact into the removal of trump without a smoking gun that almost certainly does not exist? <S_SEP> i'd combine points 1, 3, and 5: mr. trump sees virtue in a cooperative relationship with russia that ignores russian domestic affairs and actions in the states of the former soviet union, hundreds of miles behind the old frontiers of the ussr. that would be a reasonable us policy, but trump also appears influenced by some ideological affinity to russian "white christian" nationalism. he may not be an ideologue, but his affinities on this seem clear, as well as his willingness to employ and empower ideologues. that may be alarming, but it's not illegal or corrupt. the key question is point #3: did trump's desire for a closer relation and his affinity for the regime lead to collaboration between his campaign and russian intelligence? it's hard to believe we'll see the "smoking guns", but there could have been a great deal of collaboration handled as "parallel activity" without explicit coordination. at this point, we should add a sixth issue: all of this furor has had the political effect of unwisely locking democrats into a rabid russophobia, making them loud advocates of a new cold war. i doubt that position will be sustainable for the party: it will divide the opposition to trump and distract the party from a domestic and economic agenda with broad popular appeal. in the absence of a "smoking gun", i fear this controversy will wear down the democrats, more than it affects trump. <S_SEP> what do putin's russia and trump's america have in common? russia has long been--and america is rapidly becoming--a thorough-going kleptocracy.<br/>america's banksters, ceoligarchs and finagliaciers in the past have generally hidden their greedy ways beneath layers of complexity and obfuscation. under the self-serving president trump, america's trend toward kleptocracy is ever more evident.<br/><br/>upon his ascent to the presidency, the entrance fees at mar-al-lago jumped from $100,000 to $200,000. the trump family has already cost the taxpayers, in security and travel fees, nearly as much as the obama family's costs for an entire year. his administration is replete with billionaires bent on diminishing the welfare of common folk.<br/><br/>we are becoming a nation dominated by the greediest among us. will we soon move forward to full russification? will we become an authoritarian society that merely retains the outward appearance of democratic practices? and will the bulk of our citizenry drift into a cynicism born of the recognition that no institution, not even the presidency, is larger than the avarice of the one heading it? and of the awareness that utter narcissistic shamelessness knows no checks and balances? <S_SEP> overall a good summary. you did leave out a few things.<br/><br/>1) flynn, who it now seems was having encrypted conversations with russia. why is that? <br/><br/>2) kushner was involved in multiple meetings. he also has billions in business tied up with russia.<br/><br/>3) while you mentioned trump's russian business ties, you kind of glossed over them. trump has had transactions with some of russia's shadiest oligarchs are mobsters. they own a disproportionate share of some of trump's properties and the prices paid were way over market price. while this is not specific to the campaign, it would make trump a criminal if it was proven that he was laundering money for the russians. <S_SEP> , russian money couldn't agree more with mr kristoff's summation, except that i would like to add that trump's immediate family members be also examind. in high risk, high stake games, most people would want to rely more on their own family than on others. trump jr by his own admission is privy to the money coming to them from the russian clique; ivanka reportedly has headed some major projects in that part of the world and hand carried large checks from those sources. it would be a case of malpractice on the part of kgb to not have tracked these deals and their own people in place to be part of the business teams. in addition, she has reportedly flown to greece and other locations ostensibly on vaction with a girl friend of putin, rupert murdoch's ex-wife. <br/><br/>it's really scary to think that our white house and national security apparatus is indebted to putin through money and medals. with all our resources we have never been able to make a clean sweep like that in the smallest of banana states. no wonder they love putin in his country, and perhaps fear in our own official circles. <S_SEP> , russian government's involvement in usa your remark that "democrats should avoid descending into the kind of conspiratorial mind-set that led some republicans to assume hillary clinton was a criminal" is avoiding the reality that republicans lied, and lied, and lied about hillary clinton deliberately---not from some kind of paranoid mind-set, but from malice aforethought.<br/><br/>the recent news that citicorp, one of the ten largest petroleum corporations in the us, owes $billions to the russian government it is very disturbing news. if rosneft becomes a major stakeholder in an american company, we have trouble!<br/><br/>with our secretary of state firing most of the employees in the state dept., we have a staunch friend of russia, reigning in solitary splendor in his dept--and that's not ok!<br/><br/>but who is going to step up and hold the trump administration to account? <S_SEP> what should concern us more: a president who lies, obfuscates, and bullies or a congress that refuses to confront him, hold him accountable, or even admit that he lies? <br/><br/>the fact - the fact - that trump is not leading the charge for a full and impartial investigation into the russian connections is proof enough that he is not interested in putting the good of the country first. worse than that, he is probably not capable of doing so. <S_SEP> , ukraine affair trump is a con man, a liar and a fraud. he has been that way his whole life and he doesn't care about anyone or anything but himself. the question at hand is whether he colluded with putin to win, and the evidence suggests that he did. the republicans don't care, they want to pass their legislative agenda and trump is their best shot.<br/>we need a special prosecutor to investigate and provide evidence for impeachment, that is the only way out of this infernal mess. <S_SEP> the trump organization, having become toxic to us lenders, became dependent on "alternative" sources of $$, likely including $$ looted by russian oligarchs. this made trump an easy mark for russian interference in our election, the objective of which is to end the sanctions. trump's "bromance" with putin is simply an act of self-preservation. the cost to america for this unholy alliance is incalculable. <S_SEP> there is another point here, perhaps a sixth theory of trump's inappropriate involvement with russia, albeit a more indirect one. that is trump's effort to delegitimize the american news media. why is he doing this? in part, he hates criticism and wants to discredit anyone who disagrees with him. that the main reason, however, is that when the truth about his russian ties is finally uncovered, it will be so devastating that trump's only defense will be to try to blame the media for disseminating fake news. <S_SEP> trump seems to need recognition, affection, respect, etc. desperately. who likes him? people with deplorable values(white supremacy, xenophobia, nationalism, etc.), people who believe america's way forward is to magically return to the 1950's, and people who found the republicans' ridiculous caricature of hillary clinton compelling for whatever reason (having nothing to do with the actual person). that's not a lot of people. what they lack in numbers they make up for in intensity and devotion, but he knows the score. putin shows him respect, he's in. doesn't hurt that putin can probably pull the plug on trump's business 'empire' by calling-in or even just making public trump's debts to russian parties. putin's interest? a malleable us leader and a compromised america. i imagine he likes trump a lot. <S_SEP> , russia and u.s. embassy leadership "the curious world of donald trump’s private russian connections" -- seems to bear this out, the plan has been built and cultivated for years. <a href="http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/12/19/the-curious-world-of-donald-trumps-private-russian-connection" title="http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/12/19/the-curious-world-of-donald-trumps-private-russian-connection" target="_blank">http://www.the-american-interest.com/2016/12/19/the-curious-world-of-don...</a>.<br/><br/>your points might also explain why some 80 countries are without u.s. embassy leads and tillerson, who was ready to ink a oil dev deal worth $500 billion with the russians, has left the state department virtually headless, with 34 senior jobs left unfilled. his firing of senior staff, some of whom had served under four presidents, and who had collectively 150 years of institutional knowledge--seemed very bizarre. <S_SEP> ~<br/>~~<br/>trump's questionable contacts with russian operatives blatantly violates an investigative truism: eventually you run out of coincidences. but, uh, no.<br/><br/>by now those involved with the russians' favorite 2016 presidential campaign have to realize whether official gov't investigators, tenacious journalists like nicholas, or persistent conspiracy theory reprobates with a bit of a darkground feeling the deep backfringe the investigation isn't just going to go away. most certainly, not anytime soon.<br/><br/>what they'd really like in order to prevent any more self-inflicted complications is verification if they were under surveillance or being monitored.<br/><br/>since they can't just ask without raising suspicions, they probably wish there was some way to trigger a congressional investigation that would "inadvertently" reveal whether they were under surveillance or if any patriotic judge had issued any warrants.<br/><br/>they're probably thinking too bad there isn't some way to get congress to do their dirty work for them.<br/><br/>lifeline? call a friend? sure. . . <S_SEP> the reasons for president trump's attitude towards russia may be an accumulation of several situations --- including the activities and relationships between his family and low life gangsters and spy's for russia. one of the most underrated obstacles to doing international business is --- each one of the cultures are in part powered by underground economies or more directly mobs, mafia, yakuza, tongs, cartels, etc. the president's unreasonable attitude may be driven in part by fear --- after all we see high profile assassinations happening all over the world. what's he afraid of other then revealing his taxes? <S_SEP> to my mind, if russia gained influence with trump, there's no reason why they'd stop using that influence once the election was over. we may be looking at a tainted administration even today. <S_SEP> trump has turned self-loathing into a high art. having put every wart on display--even his repeated criminal conduct--his rage at any opposition, his bigoted/xenophobic/white supremacist beliefs, his abominable use of grief for political ends, his craven desire for autocratic power has only revealed the real nature of the republican party, now made up of 1000s of large and small trumps, each with their own absolute agenda of myth and ideology; all lack a moral compass.<br/><br/>russia, with an economy smaller than south korea's, the size of spain's, is only a player because of its nuclear arms and its supplies of natural gas that heat europe in the winters; without these strategic advantages, it would be in a conversation of world powers. it is a strong state that robs its citizenship. but trump admires putin's use of fear and power and desperately wants to do a deal--even one that will benefit his magic thinking to the determent of the country. <S_SEP> aside from trump's going back and forth on what his familiarity was with v. putin, the thing i can't get over is trump's very public request of russia to hack hrc's "30,000" emails. hootzpah this guy's got in spades. too much! trump has been incredibly lucky and skilled in playing his cards, but he bluffs way too much for us to keep falling for it, and he tends to tip his cards when he's got a surprise draw. you could call it his trump weakness. plus, we all know he cheats.<br/><br/>by the way, wouldn't the security agencies look at the candidates taxes first to make sure they're not vulnerable in that respect? seems like common sense. <S_SEP> what is troubling is the deeply asymmetric power of congress and the courts, as republicans have stripped the majority party (yes, democrats have been the actual majority in all recent elections) of representation, in addition to removing voting rights and enabling voter suppression. they've used private prisons as a form of jim crow. they've used their power to skew the courts, most spectacularly in the recent case of judge garland.<br/><br/>as the referees are fired, diplomatic offices are vacated (already done, though people seem ill informed about this), the state department has not hired people, our international communications have been gutted. people have no idea how much goodwill has been built up for relatively little investment on the international stage. that has been gutted, which fits fine with what putin wants.<br/><br/>trump's juvenile idea that force alone is enough fits well with his own bullying history. it is hard for most of us to even imagine someone so lacking in morality, so sure that the acquisition of wealth for himself and his supporters, the punishment of anyone who has ever dared to face him, is the sole good. we are catching up with a monster. even most of his supporters have no clue that he has no value for them except to feed his monstrous ego. most of them are a whole lot nicer than he is.<br/><br/>it is not haunting, it is monstrous. here's more:<br/><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency" title="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-tycoon-behind-the-trump-presidency" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/27/the-reclusive-hedge-fund-ty...</a> <S_SEP> alas the damage has been done already. there are enough people who believe that the obama administration was out to sabotage or hurt trump because obama favored clinton for the presidency or just because of what trump has said and tweeted. if trump and his cabal had kept quiet this investigation would not be as controversial. in fact it could be collegial because neither side is in a hurry to learn that their candidate was compromised by russian interference. that is a frightening thought for future elections in that we won't know if the choice we make is the choice we want or need in terms of an elected official.<br/><br/>the fact that several of trump's appointees weren't forthcoming about their russian contacts does look suspicious even if they did nothing wrong. the gop seems to have learned nothing from previous administrations that had similar credibility problems. (clinton's lying about his involvement with lewinsky.) it's one thing to forget but glossing over it in order to get to a position of power does create suspicion and trump and his people have done an admirable job arousing suspicion. <br/><br/>i think that both sides need to follow the trails, the money, and let the evidence take them where it will. if the gop doesn't want to follow up that will be an answer of sorts. americans need to know that there was a fair election and that there will be fair elections in the future. too much is riding on this to do otherwise. <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair i would feel comfortable describing donald trump "as sometimes appearing/seeming unhinged" if he was trying to convince me to sign a lease on a condo in manhattan. unfortunately, he is potus. "dangerous and unstable" are more appropriate adjectives describing the current state of affairs radiating from the head of state (sometimes) occupying the white house. wake up america! there is a strong skunk smell emanating from the white house and the kremlin. keep digging... this is not a television series... this is really happening. the story will unfold and we will learn what we already know. trump is putin's puppet. but who else is involved? stay tuned. <S_SEP> motive is really clear. money! trump got many loans from deutsche bank. he got those loans when us banks would not loan money to him. he was on the verge of bankruptcy. thus he had no collateral. deutsche bank was just indicted for money laundering - russian money. it doesn't take a genius to figure out where the donald got his money. he had to give them something .... was it information on people? it was known for sometime he wanted to run for president. the attack on the us by the hackers was planned, carefully, meticulously for a long period of time. they knew who and when to strike. did they also give us a candidate? phone calls between trumps loan officer at deutsche bank and russia might tell an interesting story? <S_SEP> , putin's recommendation then it might seem real, but is he safe? how did he get roped in with these dopes? did putin recommend him to trump? <S_SEP> i suspect that there are far more than mere dots to tie scheme trump to russia.<br/><br/>perhaps vladimir putin will leak trump's personal and corporate income tax returns along with his personal and corporate business holding records, contacts and deals. <br/><br/>or maybe xi jinping will be so inclined to embarrass the russian bear hugging of our so-called presidential apprentice trump. <br/><br/>the chinese dragon is rising while the russian bear is setting. about 20% of humanity is ethnic han chinese. the ethnic russian orthodox majority is rapidly aging and shrinking in a russian nation of 143 million persons. america spends 9x more on arms annually than russia. while china spends a third of america on arms.<br/><br/>or donald can ask his ethnic slavic communist atheist 1st wife ivana and 3rd wife melania what their fellow ethnic slavic communist atheist blood brother czar wannabe vladimir vladimirovich putin really intends to do. <br/><br/>w imagined that he got a sense of putin's soul while gazing in his icy blue eyes. obama thought that he had more flexibility to big red reset button the russian american relationship. their delusional lunacy seems to be contagious. putin is sculpting and skulking and stalking america in plain sight. <S_SEP> "he sometimes seems unhinged". he would appear to be increasingly that and as his administration continues to flounder and his base discerns he is the consummate liar and deplorable character the world has already gotten a good crystal clear sense of he will continue to unravel, shades of nixon in his final days as he became more paranoid, reclusive and off the rails. there is in all likelihood no grand conspiracy here between putin and trump but there are far too many dots and data points within a circumscribed time span to summarily slough off the contacts between what would appear to be in many instances russian intelligence and trump minions. where there's smoke there's likely fire, not always, but more often than not and there are plumes of very dark smoke coming out of the white house chimney these days. a comprehensive, impartial and quick investigation needs to take place so that there is some closure and resolution to the troubling questions - what did trump know, when did he know it and what was the motivation for all the contacts (i.e., data points). <S_SEP> trump admires and wants to replicate putin's business model: use governmental power for personal gain. <S_SEP> , vladimir putin's and steve bannon's motivations i always find it helpful to ask the question, "what do you want?", when trying to uncover people's true motivations.<br/><br/>1. donald trump - wants money, fame/attention, and to be both loved and feared.<br/><br/>2. hillary clinton - wants to be president, have power, and a ensure her own historic legacy. she would strengthen the administrative state. she is no friend of russia.<br/><br/>3. vladimir putin - wants to contain or weaken nato and the eu, and to solidify or expand the russian regional sphere or influence. a weakened, or domestically distracted, u.s. helps advance this agenda. (the u.s. is far less likely to intervene in ukraine or syria if we have our own troubles or scandals at home.) nato and the eu are consistent with the status quo of the "administrative state" in the u.s.<br/><br/>4. steve bannon - wants "deconstruction of the administrative state." this is consistent with putin's goals, but for different reasons.<br/><br/>----<br/>now think back to the election of 2016. almost nobody expected mr. trump to win in november. few people expected him to win the republican nomination before that.<br/><br/>putin interfered in the u.s. election to weaken american institutions and sow the seeds of doubt. the russians also hacked the republicans. had any other (anti-russian) republican been nominated, putin would have leaked republican info as well.<br/><br/>the democrats, if anything, wanted trump as the republican nominee. no one took him seriously. the conventional wisdom was that he would defeat himself in november. <S_SEP> donald is flailing and thrashing about deflecting everything in all directions. <br/><br/>indeed the facts are beginning to cut to the bone of the problem. <br/><br/>trump's team had a crystal ball or there must have been a two way conversation with the russians for his minions to predict so accurately days before the releases of the damaging documents. <br/><br/>coincidence? nonsense! a completely open inquiry is the only way to air these issues of the legitimacy of this election! <br/><br/>what donald fears the most is being exposed to the world as a fraud. <S_SEP> the russia issue must be examined immediately, and an organized movement is needed to make it happen. we all have to step up. trump, who has no mandate, trashes america's constitutional and broader institutional order to protect the dominance of his own obvious incompetence. eager to use his legislative pen to advance cruel policies ignoring the glaring needs of the poor, the middle class, and the environment to preserve their victory in the class war they've won in favor of the wealthy, republican leaders ignore this national crisis. one option is to smugly await the republicans' owning the tragic consequences. a better choice is to rise up to affirm the best american values. those values demand that the government that works for all of us serve the common good. <S_SEP> it's trump's business interests that are driving his behavior towards russia and v.putin. trump sees russia as the perfect source of investment funding from a political ecosystem with untraceable capital flowing from russian state-run entities.<br/><br/>the problem is that the oligarchs doing the lending are not really deal makers who rejoice in the "art of the deal." instead, they invest only in what they can control lock, stock and barrel (again, using russian state capital). simply stated, trump is up to his earlobes in debt to political criminals, with v.putin as the ceo of the russian kleptocracy. <S_SEP> ryanhil -- big difference between questioning whether journalists have any info to support their theories and supporting all things russia. no one on the trump side supports russia or would prefer russian style government etc. but at the same time, there is no reason not to attempt to normalize relations, create legitimate alliances where possible.<br/><br/>jeanne prine - of course the timing of the hack is important. in fact, you prove my point. the mantra on the left is that the russians hacked to help trump win and that trump collaborated or even asked the russians to hack. but the timing proves otherwise. yes, they probably wanted to annoy hrc -- but that is a far cry from deliberately trying to swing the election to trump. <br/><br/>j barrett<br/><br/>who is being obtuse? of course journalists are suppose to ferret out the truth -- but there is a difference between ferreting out the truth and simple rumor mongering -- particularly when the rumor mongering has a partisan odor about it. <S_SEP> no us bank will lend him money, due to his multiple bankruptcies and obvious financial incompetence (building four casinos on one block in atlantic city, trump steaks, trump university, etc.), so he has to go overseas to get any liquidity, at great cost. he needs putin's cash inflow, because his daddy isn't around any longer ore to bail him out by sending flunkies down to buy chips at his casino. <br/><br/>he is underwater, in bed with fascist dictators, and way over his head. <S_SEP> the thing is, the "russian smoke" is just the leading argument against trump. there are at least three other (lesser) arguments that can be made as to why he is unfit to lead america.<br/>1.) this week we learn about the trademarks being granted by china. if something isn't done about this, i want all high school civic classes (if you can get to one depending on your voucher situation) to refer to our government going forward as an oligarchy or kleptocracy and we need the emoluments clause immediately stricken from the record.<br/>2.) repeatedly lying to americans. has he hit the 300 mark on outright fibs told yet? the latest and most serious being that he was subject to illegal wire tapping by the previous administration.<br/>3.)knee-jerk governance by executive order and a budget that makes no sense. wasting tax payer money on solutions that have no adjoining problem and not funding what currently works (see stupid border wall vs. coast guard budget for example). every other wrong-headed, mean-spirited, stupid, fiscally irresponsible policy gets a huge embrace. <br/><br/>trumpers, wake up. i'm sorry you felt so disenfranchised that you had to foist this tyrant upon us, but this guy is ruining america and is beholden to nothing buy his piggy bank. stop enabling this buffoon.
i suspect that the dots have already been connected and that the fbi and intelligence communities are looking for smoking guns. not sure if they will find them. <br/><br/>why were trump campaign officials meeting with russians, especially after the wikileaks dump and exposing of russian hacking? and why did trump and others deny such meetings? and why did trump dispute, for so long, the consensus opinion of the intelligence community about russian involvement? what explains trump's rejection of the intelligence community? (the "deep state" is adolescent political junk science).<br/><br/>collusion with russian officials or apparatchiks to affect the campaign could be be express or tacit. if trump and/or his campaign knew or suspected that russians were meddling in the campaign and nevertheless discussed what benefits russia could expect from a trump presidency, that could be tacit collusion. that is why sessions' meeting with the russian ambassador in september looms large. <br/><br/>at a minimum, trump and/or people in his campaign knew, at some point during the campaign, that russia was meddling in the election and that the meddling benefitted them. if they met with russians after they knew and didn't object to the meddling. that is tacit collusion. <S_SEP> ”if mr. trump’s assertion that there was no collusion between his campaign officials and the russian government is true, he should want this matter to be fully investigated as quickly and as transparently as possible”<br/><br/>and the answer is: he doesn't. <S_SEP> dot connection is a hard process unless all facts are known. once facts are known and placed in a timeline, dots tend to connect themselves. so far, the clearest dots show conversations between trump campaign people, the watering down of the ukraine plank in the republican platform and then the release of the wikileaks material from the dnc hack.<br/>my speculation is that trump and his cohorts were never bothered by their collusion with the russians because winning is everything and they had already demonized hillary. it was a wonderful windfall and they never thought twice about it. <S_SEP> had this happened under obama or hillary republicans would turn this investigation into a public spectacule. can we say benghazi anyone.<br/><br/>the american people deserve an open, honest investigation. if it turns out that trump is innocent of colluding with the russians during his campaign then we will move on. but we won't be able to do so if this matter is investigated under the radar by a compromised justice department.<br/><br/>if sessions has nothing to hide he won't have a problem with appointing an independent prosecutor to investigate this matter with transparency. should he refuse to do so we will need the press to keep digging and keep us informed. our democracy deserves nothing less. <S_SEP> agreed that a full investigation is warranted in this situation. but it shouldn't restrict itself to any possible connection to russian interference in our elections but should also focus on finding and stopping up the leaks of confidential national security information that have been emanating from the intelligence community over the last few months.<br/><br/>that being said, i find it ironic that the times is now (properly) concerned that doj officials might not have the political independence to conduct a proper investigation. i wonder where that concern was when loretta lynch met privately with the spouse of a supposed target of investigation just before everybody suddenly finding an intent requirement in a law that doesn't have one so as to ensure no prosecution of a politically favored individual. or where the concern was when the doj slow walked and ultimately ignored irs officials abusing their position for political purposes.<br/><br/>one expects political partisans to have double standards in these matters. it would be refreshing were the paper of record to avoid that pitfall for a change. <S_SEP> no determination of the quantifiable impact of the russian election meddling on the 2016 vote will be forthcoming, it is fundamentally not on the investigative agenda of the doj or the congress. <br/><br/>despite all the negatives that befell the clinton candidacy from the russian actions, hrc still received the greater number popular votes by a significant amount.<br/><br/>two basic issues remain, the seminal question whether there was trump campaign collusion in the russian interference and the source of the classified leaks to the press. the issue of the leaks is monumentally dwarfed by the possibility that trump campaign officials or advisors h colluded with russia government intermediaries operatives or other entities. the facts of this unprecedented incident and lessons learned are important, but clearly resolving the question of possible collusion is unquestionably of paramount importance.<br/><br/>any hint of the current presidential administration having sway over the direction or outcomes of the investigation of these matters is absolutely intolerable. <br/><br/>the only right course, as this editorial so aptly proclaims, is an independent investigation with full legal authority and unrestricted subpoena powers. <S_SEP> the fact that the fbi is investigating trump's slimy russian connections and election-tampering is only a "breathtaking admission" if you haven't been reading the times own reporting for the last 6 months. <br/><br/>what may be "breathtaking" is the fact that this corruption is so blatant that even the ethically-challenged comey decided he had to at least "investigate" in order to save face. <br/><br/>and it will be "breathtaking" if this investigation somehow get buried and doesn't lead to prosecutions and/or removals from office. <S_SEP> why would we need an investigation? mr. kristof seems to have read a few reports and drawn a conclusion, as have a few other op/ed writers. these are the same op/ed writers who concluded president obama had a far-too-cozy relationship with incoming president putin after the message for medvedev to give to putin that "he must give me space". right? remember the opinion pieces connecting obama's dots to russia? <br/><br/>t <S_SEP> today was a harrowing day. even worse is the continuing "breaking news" that seems to be on the rise. just tonight were two items: one from reuters reporting that rex tillerson is skipping a meeting of nato, and instead will visit russia! now that takes brass.<br/><br/>the other is more evidence of corrupt money funneled by ukrainians to paul manafort via a shell account in the caribbean.<br/><br/>you can't make this stuff up. who needs spy novels? john le carre or tom clancy don't need to write anymore--they only need to lift the months headlines.<br/><br/>what amazes me the most about the fbi various investigations, is how the trump team is responding. so far, it's just taunts of fake news, but their behavior says otherwise. the wagons are gathering in a circle, and i honestly don't think they know what to do. but trump's increasingly erratic and bizarre behavior reveal a man with his pants down: scared to death of what they have he can't attack.<br/><br/>for a man who insists on maintaining total control over staff, policy, and appearances, it must be very unsettling. <br/><br/>but if and when he falls, i don't think there will be many left to catch him. all things russia aside, in jut 50 days, he's set a new record for corruption in government, from nepotism and self dealing to a record number of outright lies ever attributed to a sitting president. <S_SEP> now, trump and russia are suddenly keeping a public distance of each other, a behavior that might reflect the intention of hiding the connection. <S_SEP> there’s another consideration: if trump and his campaign were innocent of any suspicious activity with the kremlin, he should be the first to call for an independent investigation to clear his name. why wouldn’t he? this issue is in the back of everyone’s mind, members of congress included. get rid of it and that’s one less weight encumbering his political agenda, one less bargaining chip in play. plus, he could use the finding as ammunition against the “fake news” media and other detractors.<br/><br/>the fact that he doesn’t call for such an investigation, and his associates repeatedly lie about their contacts, makes me there’s a there, there. <S_SEP> "obama's own intelligence chief said there is zero evidence of collusion."....but that does not mean the russians were not hoping to gain some favorable considerations from the trump campaign for their attacks on clinton. absence of any collusion is not an argument that the russian intrigue in our election should not be fully investigated. we need to know exactly what the russians were trying to do irrespective of any trump campaign involvement. <S_SEP> , special prosecutor the real question once was, is, and will be in the future: "what did the president know, and when did he know it?"<br/><br/>when i look at the video of trump during the campaign and see trump urging the russians to see if they can find hillary's lost emails i have to believe he was telegraphing in public what was going on in private: trump directed his underlings to collude with the russians to defeat hillary clinton.<br/><br/>special prosecutor? yes, indeed, and the sooner the better. and get the articles of impeachment ready. <S_SEP> we know that russia hacked our elections in an effort to help trump because of the declassified report issued by the director of national intelligence on january 6th. how are you still unaware of these findings? <S_SEP> in point #3, regarding the mysterious server connection, it's worth linking to the slate article. the slate article goes into more technical detail and even interviews paul vixie. paul vixie *invented* the network protocol used by the mysterious server connection, and he had special privilege of investigating the raw network data firsthand.<br/><br/>.<a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html" title="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_a_server_registered_to_the_trump_organization_communicating_with_russia.html" target="_blank">http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/10/was_...</a> <S_SEP> this is perhaps the saddest day in us history: the trump administration/campaign is being investigated by the fbi for collusion with russia's attempt to influence our election. in simple terms: our president and his team are being investigated for possible acts of treason. treason.<br/><br/>sadder still: republicans on the intelligence committee don't even care about that (i watched, i heard their questions). they are nearly singularly focused on talking about leaks. <br/><br/>the only thing that could be sadder than what is going on today? not catching each of them and removing them from government. <S_SEP> i can't. that's honest. now i ask you - would you have really voted for trump if you knew the fbi at that time was investigating his campaign for possible collusion with the russians?? <S_SEP> yes, the hacking of the dnc occurred in summer of 2015. before trump. but it was perhaps always the russian goal of blocking clinton, no matter who she ran against. once it became evident it was trump, they started releasing all the data. <br/><br/>please don't be so obtuse.<br/><br/>the job of journalists is to ferret out stories and the truth because the rest of us are busy leading our lives. ask yourself what this country would look like without journalists. i suggest it isn't a pretty picture. <br/><br/>we have never had a president so closely tied with russia. i, for one, am glad journalists are on the job, working to make sure we keep this president and his administration honest. we don't live in russia, after all. and just because trump says so, doesn't make it so. <S_SEP> some clarity about motive will emerge with the comparison of dates of the phone calls between 45 campaign people and russian intelligence and statements made by 45 during his campaign. circumstantial evidence of collusion seems pretty self-evident right now. <S_SEP> trump wants the fbi to drop the investigations into russia's interference with the election. now, isn't that convenient for trump. just drop any investigations that don't agree with him. i bet all criminals wish they could order their investigations away. <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair excellent article. the facts are coming out bit by bit. the dossier from christopher steele clearly indicates collusion to treason by the trump campaign. and as the noose is tightened, trump is acting ever more erratic.<br/><br/>it is apparent that the chickens are coming home to roost, it appears that despite political obfuscation at the top, the law enforcement agencies of the us government will continue to do their duty in the true interests of the american people. it appears that there will be enough congressmen and senators with a conscience that the truth wil come out. democrats will never sit still for a coverup. if so, it is very possible that this will explode into one of the biggest scandals in us history. <br/><br/>but what i suspect is this: it is also possible that tump and his followers knew that this day would come and that all this would eventually be brought to the light of day. that being the case, could it be that their attempts to delegitimize the media, particularly the new york times and cnn, are simply an attempt to prepare the battlefield for the war ahead? if 44% of the american public is dumb enough to follow trump right or wrong, could it be that the trump administration is simply preparing the minds of his devotees so that they will be trained and pre-brainwashed enough, such that when the proof is finally found and reported showing his collusion with enemies of the us, his followers will simply reject it as fake news and continue to support him? <S_SEP> it is interesting, to say the least, that while don the con and his groveling sycophants, including sean spicer, are attempting to "distance themselves" from paul manafort (who was the ceo of the campaign for 5 months, for the record - not a "minimal role"), and michael flynn - they have failed to mention that jeff sessions also had multiple meetings with the russians, about which he lied. while the gotp apologists for all of this claim that these was merely "diplomatic meetings," the fact is that sessions was not in any way elected to "represent" the diplomatic missions of the united states - he was a member of don the con's campaign. we need a fully independent and comprehensive investigation of the obvious complicity between trump's campaign and the russians. comey has zero credibility - and neither does sessions. bring on an independent prosecutor - and let the chips fall where they may and - in all likelihood - should. 3/21, 9:08 am <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair, impeachment call the opposing party has not said that trump colluded with the russians it is an investigation into collusion by the fbi. although his tweets are rather enlightening shall we say. second i only said i believe the republicans would be calling for an impeachment were the president democrat. i didn't state anyone was guilty or should be impeached. <S_SEP> the investigation needs to go back further than the election. we need to understand why trump is compromised by russia. these actions precede the election and the dossier points to financial and personal compromise of trump by the russians. these russian compromises dictate how trump behaves and how he treats russia at the expense of america and our allies. <S_SEP> or, the truth, courtesy wsws:<br/><br/>the whole purpose of the congressional hearings...has less to do with trump than with the acceleration and intensification of the preparations for war with russia. this was acknowledged in the opening remarks of the house intelligence committee chairman, republican rep. devin nunes, who declared that whatever his disagreements with the democrats, “one benefit” of the hearing was already clear. “it has focused wide attention on the pressing threats posed by the russian autocrat” and set the stage “for stronger action against russian belligerence.”<br/><br/>the working class confronts a conflict between two vile and reactionary camps, which are arguing over the best and fastest path to war. the democrats want russia to be target number one. trump, however, views china and germany as the preferred targets in the new struggle for world domination.<br/><br/>this conflict between two criminal gangs is a war of liars: the lies of trump vs. the lies of the democrats. both trump and the democrats represent and defend the interests of the wall street banks and the giant corporations, and are prepared to sacrifice the lives of millions of working people in new wars to defend the global dominance of american imperialism.<br/><br/>one fundamental political lesson must be drawn from the filthy proceedings in washington. the fight of the working class against trump must be developed entirely independently of and in opposition to the political cesspool known as the democratic party. <S_SEP> i think it is a collusion involving at least one party on either side, the object of which was to place donald trump in the white house. i will disavow this belief on the day i hear trump say, "i welcome a full and complete investigation of all contacts between people associated with me and those associated with putin. i offer any and all persons to testify under oath, and i submit all records and documents to the investigative body."<br/><br/>on the day that happens, i will promise to cast my vote for trump in 2020. <S_SEP> where was donald trump yesterday?<br/><br/>oh, he was still campaigning in kentucky, someone needs to tell donald trump that it's time to do some work in the whitehouse........ never mind the regular weekly golf excursions to mar-a-lago.......never mind the campaigning to change the subject....... no more moronic tweets......the presidential trainee period is over........ it's time to prove you can do the job you were elected to do.<br/><br/>what is the most shameful revelation yesterday, was when the voters went to vote they were thinking that hillary clinton was under investigation by the fbi, but in reality donald trump and his campaign was the one under investigation since last july and that would have been a big game changer......and now we know beyond a doubt that donald trump in nothing more than a gold plated liar!
what an admirable position---that the president of a constitutional democracy should actually not have profitable financial ties to a former enemy, a dictatorship that seeks to influence our elections. unprecedented.<br/><br/>how far america has fallen that we have to cope with such an issue, with all the grave national problems to be addressed. we’re forced to worry about the corruption, hypocrisy and lies of the us president, which will hold us back from bringing the us up to 21st century standards of democracy and equality. <br/><br/>the positions of dt and vp will keep shifting for one-upmanship. they have no principles. <br/><br/>now reports say the putin govt is getting suspicious and wary of trump. he’s an undependable ally, even to the russians!<br/>russia is preparing for putin a dossier on donald’s psychological makeup. dt is a “ a risk-taker who can be naïve.”<br/>trump "doesn't understand fully who is mr. putin — he is a tough guy," former deputy foreign minister andrei fedorov told nbc news. <br/><br/>interesting developments ahead to keep our news media speculating. <S_SEP> dt has consistently acted exactly the way he would if he were compromised and under putin's control. this is not just naivete, or a coincidence, or a weird personal fetish. why won't dt release his tax returns? (see kristof's #9.) why not stop acting like a puppet and put the interests of the usa first? until dt shows us otherwise, the most logical answer is that putin owns him. <S_SEP> ascribing trump's russian posture to "an ideological alliance" presupposes his intellectual capacity to contemplate the nuances of geopolitical dynamics. that's as far off as thinking he's an avid reader.<br/><br/>the financial side of things makes more sense. in addition to his tax returns, he should release his passports, including all of his visa stamps for the last twenty years, even though one wonders if the irs would publically state that any released tax documents are indeed copies of what was actually filed (or, on the other hand, "sanitized"), or if the state dept. would verify the passports as authentic. <br/><br/>probably at the direction of putin, rex was installed as the sec. of state: exxonmobil holds exclusive drilling rights to the russian arctic, where between $500 billion and one trillion in oil sit. the only things preventing that company's drilling are the sanctions, which is why there's backroom talk of how to get rid of them. can you say "kickback?" can you say "hotel &amp; condo building permits in moscow?"<br/><br/>"i've never met him. i've never had any business in russia," trump says. how about the $10 million profit from miss universe? <S_SEP> thank you for this editorial. yesterday's testimony from both senior officials was substantive &amp; forthright, though understandably minimalist. two statements of director comey's should ignite concern: that there is a risk of further russian interference with the 2018 elections; and that it is impossible to determine how long it will take for the counterintelligence operation to reach a final conclusion. both are reasonable statements. any american that worries about long-term scenarios for their offspring, their community, their country, their species, the planet as a whole must understand that there is an overriding moral imperative to assure competent, honest, selfless leadership in our nation's capital. do we have that in the trumps? no. obviously not. ivanka trump is today being set up in her own office with unlimited access to classified information. that white house perch is being monetized to a historically unprecedented level by a set of craven opportunists who are using the gop as a human shield while mining priceless government databases. it's far worse than that, actually, but that's the short version of this tale. it is self-evident that they will do anything to assure clan rule for the remainder of human history, if allowed. unless the people, congress &amp; le set aside partisan preferences &amp; react to what is actually unfolding in real time, we will be trapped in a twilight zone version of america for the rest of our lives. that is why prosecutors must act quickly. <S_SEP> the mi6 dossier mentions that trump made a deal that, if he could get russian sanctions lifted, he and his fellow white house russophiles would be given 19% of rosneft, russia's second largest oil company. this makes all the sense in the world - it's all about money for himself - and it makes even more sense of his pick of rex tillersson as secretary of state, who is doing nothing in public. the trump/putin presidency is now an extension of the kind of state-sponsored oligarchic rule we see in russia - that is their ideology. congress must take a strong stand against lifting sanctions and save the free world from putin's fascism. <S_SEP> , eu, nato, russia and trump, ukraine's sovereignty, agreement trump did more than just gain russian help, he and his campaign aides colluded to win the election. trump made a deal! he and his friends are now very afraid of what is to come, as they cannot keep their part of the deal, which was to lift sanctions towards russia, allow them to takeover (lease) land in the ukraine to steal its oil (like trump said we should have iraq), open up the artic to exxon drilling, and help break up the alliances of eu, nato, etc. etc. as trump inferred with this pesky investigation, he can't do any deals with russia! i think he can't keep the bargain with the devil. he and his pals should be afraid, as now they have to fear what the russian journalists feared and that is outright murder or death by poisoning. in comparison, our opposition to his government really isn't troubling them. heck, he can blame obama for everything and get away with it! <S_SEP> , russia's tampering with the election do check out recent reporting by rachel maddow and the new yorker. it's perfectly clear that russia is getting what they want in return for hacking our democracy (not the voting machines, but all the one-sided "leaks" and lies, etc.).<br/><br/>a gutted state department with a russian friend at its head<br/><br/>ukrainian modifications in republican plans.<br/><br/>putin is a wily bird, and there's lots of lots of material for speculation as to how many of these people are blackmailable.<br/><br/>do we really want bannon and putin in charge? <S_SEP> nick: thanks for cutting to the chase. you rock!<br/><br/>now to hurrying along this momentous threat to our democracy:<br/><br/>scotus: you have the facts. you see that this administration is incapable of investigating itself. the election was tainted. call for a new election for president/vice president and issue a state of emergency.<br/><br/>as nick said we need an independent inquiry, and likely an independent prosecutor to go after the facts and subsequent prosecutions for treason.<br/><br/>whistle-blowers: support our democracy and involve the public by leaking anonymously to reality-based respected media--trump's tax returns for the past 10 years, russian connections and true health status.<br/><br/>everyday, important laws and protections are being removed by these villains. jobs lost, respect lost, science lost. we cannot wait a moment longer. step up scotus and whistle-blowers! <S_SEP> no, he is. putin actually is running our country. i am beginning to believe more of the so-called unsubstantiated dossier. <S_SEP> oh, investigators are getting close alright, nicholas! the angrier and crazier trump gets to me says, he's running scared.<br/><br/>the best media source on all dots russian is rachel maddow. every night she uncovers new sources, new data points, many substantiated by guests she has on her show. and these dots keep getting hotter. <br/><br/>the latest being the gutting of the state department, as rex tillerson, best bud of vlad, increasingly heads a ghost ship at state. all the layoffs and firings of career experience, down the drain. tex holds photo ops, but never speaks, in contrast to the regular press conferences kerry held, as he did the real work of diplomacy out in the world while rex stays home and waits.<br/><br/>what is he waiting for? i'm pretty sure it has to do with the timing of the lifting of sanctions, in order to watch his remaining stock in exxon mobil soar, putin grin, and trump get his 19%.<br/><br/>it's a waiting game as well as a long one--as trump himself keeps getting enmeshed in his own attempts to divert attention to what's "really going on", in his favorite phrase.<br/><br/>please, mr. trump: what is really going on? <S_SEP> plot thickens. russia has almost taken over the state department. just watch what is happening at the state, exactly what putin wants.<br/><br/>interestingly, the republican party has realized that they just have 2 years to get their work done, i.e., destroy the very institutions that makes this country the greatest on the face of this earth. god bless us all. <S_SEP> , russia and u.s. affair, ukraine affair i would add the following illustrative facts:<br/><br/>1. dmitry rybolovlev, the so called "fertilizer king," in 2008, purchased trump's palm beach mansion for$100m, 2.5 times what trump had paid for it. <br/><br/>2. wilbur ross, the new commerce secretary, and long time close friend of president trump, is a shareholder in a bank in in cyprus, with ties to putin. <br/><br/>the word of the year is "oligarch." these facts may not be on their own be dispositive but continue to betray a pattern that will hopefully bring this president to heel. while there may never be proof of a quid pro quo, we must widen the aperture: this is a nihilist of a president and his history (see, for example, your colleague messr. blow's column today) demonstrates to anyone paying attention that his ego wants what his ego wants. <br/><br/>his sole operating priniciple is to try and try to fill the gaping hole in his shamed and wanting psyche with as much money and adulation as he can get. <br/><br/>this is no longer a game; truth and decency, and yes, world order, and human lives, will now become the casualties. <S_SEP> the only problem is that safeguarding american democracy is the last thing republicans in congress care about. as long as they get to be in charge, the fact that donald trump and his associates colluded with the russians--perhaps even offered them specific benefits in exchange for help during the election--will be just one more thing to be overlooked, minimized, or swept under the rug. after all, this is the same party that has made systematic state-level efforts to disenfranchise large numbers of voters standard practice, and the same party who is now holding confirmation hearings for neil gorsuch only because they unconstitutionally refused to consider the legitimate nomination of merrick garland to the supreme court. in other words, for republicans american democracy is as likely to be seen as an impediment as it is an ideal. <S_SEP> it appears the question behind all this partisan squabbling is "can you say coup?" it's a terrifying to think that putin picked the president and now our entire government is being picked apart, immobilized, and run by those intent on its disruption and if not all out destruction. <br/><br/>it's time for tempestuous republicans to get over their power hangover and wake up to the fact that they enabled a foreign power and former foe take over the most powerful branch of our government. failure to act only illuminates their own collusion. <S_SEP> creation of an independent bipartisan commission is by far the best path to getting the facts about russia's attack on our democracy, any involvement by trump campaign staff, and do so way in a way that can be accepted by most americans. <br/><br/>the refusal of republican leaders to support such an approach is rapidly threatened not only their party but our democracy. <S_SEP> , an independent investigation, russia and usa now is the time for every good man and woman to come to the aid of their country by demanding an independent investigation with a special prosecutor to examine all of the evidence including trump's tax returns and questioning christopher steele about the information in his dossier. <br/><br/>putin aggressively conducted a covert operation undermining our most sacred democratic institution, yet the key operatives he used are running our country, further destroying our state department, intelligence services, free press, and our former president.<br/><br/>mitch mcconnell, paul ryan and the republican establishment are equally responsible for allowing russia to undermine our government with impunity, by turning their backs on this dangerous electoral college so called president as he further takes us down the"primrose path of dalliance" with putin. <br/><br/>the truth will come out, and the sooner the better so that sanity can be restored and we can undertake the long road back to a functioning government<br/>free of trump, bannon, and putin. <S_SEP> let's also not forget that our new secretary of state rex tillerson was a total unknown to trump before the election. there are critical layoffs of key personnel at state, with a 37% budget cut, if i have that figure right. he is also refusing to speak to the press but only allows them photo ops when he is meeting with other heads of state. he, too, was placed there by the russians to dismantle our state department, which sets out our world view and policy that putin would like to see neutered. <S_SEP> breath-taking, all of it. i thought comey acquitted himself very well under the circumstances. what he didn't say, and what he couldn't comment upon, was almost as telling as what he revealed.<br/><br/>i think this extract says it all: "if mr. trump’s assertion that there was no collusion between his campaign officials and the russian government is true, he should want this matter to be fully investigated as quickly and as transparently as possible." <br/><br/>that would be entirely normal and desired, they should be falling over themselves to enable a transparent investigation - but nothing is normal in the face this maelstrom of mis-information, accusations of 'fake news', and, of course, the ridiculous tweets that only serve to add fuel to the fire.<br/><br/>i don't see putin tweeting 'boo-hoo, they're being nasty to me. sad!' he is most likely vastly entertained seeing a once great nation being made to look incompetent and shambolic. i guess the big question remains: when are the republicans, who must know how much harm this is doing, going to put their country before themselves? hopefully sooner rather later. <S_SEP> look up the death of alex oronov. oronov is related to trump's lawyer, michael cohen. his death was announced by the kremlin's "peace plan for ukraine" sponsor, artemenko. it happened on march 2; read about it on the the independent.co.uk website. and let us not overlook the gutting of the us state dept, that would have more americans up in arms if they weren't more worried about the cost of their family's health care plans. these facts on the ground are strongly suggestive of a white house fulfilling kremlin wishes. that cannot be allowed to stand, wherever the investigation might lead, because it would then open the floodgates for other countries to decide to sponsor their own pet candidates, in the future. china, saudi arabia, iran: these are just a few of the powerful states that could borrow a page from putin and impose their own puppet in 2020. no: this has to stop now. subversive elements must face consequences and the whole world needs to see the american people completely in control of our own elections again. <S_SEP> , russian hoax this all boils down to the desperation on the part of dems to find any illegitimate reason (other than hrc was a terrible candidate) for trump's victory. it couldn't be that the people rejected the dems after 8 years of a muddled presidency and the dems putting forth a corrupt candidate -- otherwise -- the lefts' favorite ploy -- calling people they don't like stupid simply won't work. oh, yes, the progs call trump and his team stupid (all those generals and billionaires, how'd they succeed if they were so stupid) -but they can only get away with that as long as there is an alternative reason for the dems losing the election -- any reason will do, the more sinister the better --other than the repubs ran smart candidates at all levels and the dems approach to governance was too "stupid" for the people to allow it to continue. <br/><br/>in short -- the russian hoax is simply an orchestrated plot by dems -- including obama -- to have something to blame for their loss other than his failed policies and the incompetence and lack of appeal of the clinton campaign. <br/><br/>if the repubs are so stupid, how come they won? oh, they cheated and lied to the american people with the help of russians -- and i think big foot intimidated people at the polls and martians did something, something about ray guns or something that altered people's behavior. yeah, right. <S_SEP> your concerns about trump's loyalty to russia, in preference to u.s. interests, are valid indeed. we may be living in a world of mafiosi covering each other's nefarious acts. trump's persistent unwillingness to criticize thuggish putin is most suspicious for malfeasance yet to be uncovered. why would he choose paul manafort (last april) otherwise? manafort having severe conflicts of interest, lobbying for dictators worldwide, and as a consultant of viktor yanukovich, the ex-dictator of ukraine, a crook under the tutelage of the kremlin? turbid business for sure, but seemingly just 'business as usual' for fraudster trump. trouble is, this irresponsible and unscrupulous ignoramus is u.s. president now, unwilling, or unable, to sever dependency ties with russia. a most dangerous proposition. what we need now is patriotic leakers to allow sunshine and reveal the truth, with the facts we need to indict this 'ugly american', thus far oblivious to reason, decency and civility. <S_SEP> i believe that the economic sanctions that the european union, canada and the u. s. increased, following russia's annexation of crimea and advisory role. along with funding and arming the ukraine rebels, will be the thing to watch.<br/><br/>as russia has focused, more and more, on military spending, foregoing vital consumer needs, its economy has been devastated. if trump starts to ease them, even just a little, that would gradually enable russia to request greater flexibility, ease the consumer demand and, at the same time, shift funds into its defense budget.<br/><br/><a href="https://thetruthoncommonsense.com" title="https://thetruthoncommonsense.com" target="_blank">https://thetruthoncommonsense.com</a> <S_SEP> we are caught in a moment of national agitation where rational and reasoned approaches are rent asunder in a skirmish being fought on a technological, amoral, ad hoc battlefield. notions of justice and fairness presented through reasonable discourse are trampled by the trump regime. its enablers in congress rush to execute soulless, absurd, vapid, dangerous actions in every segment of our society. the russian story is stunning in the slow walk to remediation and public fact finding from national leadership. by the way, i'm old enough to remember that lying to congress under oath would cause a resignation. no more. in this government in crisis, i fear we think there is some rationale, patriotic cohort in the established government with the moral force to pull us back from a whirling descent into a brittle, spiritless, and dark future. this is not a moment in history for deliberation, but a time to understand and enact approaches for confronting unethical health and social legislation as well as collusion within a technological space that takes place beyond national borders. technology without an ethical platform is an anarchist's or at least a despot's dream. unfortunately, amoral people with untrained minds do not hear rational discourse. this national trump spasm ends only when good republicans and courageous democrats take action and say loudly, "enough." <S_SEP> 1. hillary and her staff are not suspected of colluding with the russians to influence the election. so no one cares.<br/>2. mr. obama was the president, not a candidate. mr. obama represented the government, and as such had the authority of the government to talk in a diplomatic capacity.<br/>3. see point 2 and substitute "government officials" for "president obama".<br/>4. nice job at grasping at straws and trying to blame the victims. at least you have been paying attention to donnies tactics. <S_SEP> , ukraine ties the washington post reported a few months ago that manafort's lobbying firm had indeed taken money from ukraine but that they in turn had passed some of the money on to podesta's lobbying firm as well as a firm connected to romney. will mr. kristof now allege that podesta and romney are also agents of the kremlin? if so, it seems like the entire us establishment is now owned by putin, no?<br/><br/><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2016/08/19/paul-manaforts-complicated-ties-to-ukraine-explained/"

i just read a comment here that complained we're obsessed with russia and trump and we're mentally ill as a result.<br/>a secret cia assessment says russia was trying to help trump win white house. the fbi's in agreement. that our spy agencies conclude russia ran an operation to install the donald is the most significant, consequential finding in years. donald repeatedly shows great fondness for putin. no comment on the fact that putin is dissing him recently.<br/>trump, in december, says ridiculous, just another excuse/don’t believe it.<br/>he's the beneficiary of a fixed election.<br/>vladimir putin of russia ordered the hacking. wikileaks is part of his propaganda tools. he also hacked into databases with republican national committee data, but released documents only on democrats. presumably putin still has the goods on the rnc. but republicans act blissfully in denial.<br/>bottom line: more information emerges from wire tapping just in january that trump's inner circle were in touch with russia, as was his campaign, before and after the election. all along, in touch with russian officials.<br/>this is all based on intelligence assessment. we are not mentally ill for refusing to accept it and move on. <S_SEP> , russian army a new red flag is the obvious and furious campaign wikileaks has launched yesterday on the cia. with prepared "summaries" for lazy media wl is attempting to plant the idea the cia is able to misdirect its own hacks as russian attacks, wl sows distrust of the ic among the electorate ("your tv us spying on you!") possibly also introduces an excuse for trump to "re-organize" the cia as a matter of urgency.<br/>such a campaign is clearly exceedingly helpful to an embattled administration and clears the news cycle of russian links. it is almost as though trump has his own army of plumbers external to the state organs (that he would normally rely on), ready to run interference when he feels vulnerable. he arrived in the job aware the intelligence community may know where his skeletons are, and is now directly attacking them on many fronts.<br/>at this point everyone on both sides should see wikileaks is as russian as rt or sputnik and their frenzy indicates the truth about campaign russia ties are emerging. <S_SEP> , russians influenced election we're to the point where we're reciting what we already know.<br/>column after column. we aren't breaking new ground.<br/>we as a nation are stuck with all republican rule.<br/>our election was influenced by russian hands. republicans used russia's wikileak dumps to campaign against democrats. they welcomed the flow of leaks, even made campaign ads you saw on your televisions.<br/>how much hope does the average person have that republican-led committees can affect any change? can force this president to disclose his secretive ties to russia? there's jeff sessions, an undying trump loyalist who will not enforce anything against trump. the attorney general himself was part of the campaign chant to jail their female political opponent. he thought this was fine. lock her up. we are in deep trouble and we gotta shake out of just delineating what we already know. <S_SEP> many commentators have made the unassailable point that russian interference in our electoral process constitutes a serious blow to our way of life. getting to the bottom of this should be a bipartisan issue. the democrats should frame their calls for an independent investigation as a matter of patriotism, in urgent language that trump's "america great again" supporters will understand. sens. schumer and warner are the natural leaders for spreading this message. to paraphrase margaret thatcher, it's no time to go "wobbly." <S_SEP> this analysis of the trump-putin connection by david leonhardt is very perceptive and accurate. <br/><br/>if there is an error, it is erring on the side of donald trump in terms of withholding judgment where hard evidence is lacking.<br/><br/>the very best that anyone can say about president trump’s foreign policy is that it is clearly -- at the very least -- naïve and reckless.<br/><br/>the worst, of course, is to call the policy and its presidential architect treasonous. at the moment, none of us can that treason is out of the question.<br/><br/>every american, regardless of political party, ought to be able to agree on one thing: we need a thorough investigation, totally independent of white house guidance, of the russian connection. <S_SEP> your analysis is spot on. i would add that putin is a professional spy. he wanted to weaken clinton and by extension the us. he was able to do this because our internal political institutions are the weakest they have been since just before the civil war. what he didn't count on was trump actually winning. now he's stuck with a crazy person in the white house. he likely has financial leverage and probably honey trap leverage. but his problem is that he can't actually use it on anything meaningful for him. because of the brave american leakers and investigators, the word is out. trump can't deliver for putin now or everyone's fears will be confirmed. <S_SEP> wow, how genius of putin to set this up so as to use trump as his shield against reprisals for his brazen activities during our election cycle. now half the country doesn't even care about what he did, they just want it swept up under the rug. and that same half is trying to move the focus to their demonizing of the free press. at today's hearing all the fire and brimstone was directed at our free press which was repeatedly maligned and threatened even to the point of the issue being raised as to whether printing leaked material was a criminal act.<br/><br/>the press is in a very threatened, tenuous position. trump and his wrecking crew will come and go but the damage done to the position of the free press in our society may well be lasting and injurious to our democracy in a fundamental way. we all know once a right/freedom is diminished it is very difficult to restore it. once the fourth pillar of our democracy is crippled the whole project will stand on shaky legs. <S_SEP> for all those of you accusing me of blaming the victim:<br/><br/>who do you think the victim is? if you say hillary clinton, you're making this the partisan thing it must not be.<br/><br/>i'm the victim. you're the victim. anyone who believes russia has no business meddling in our elections is the victim. as comey said, it won't stop here.<br/><br/>so how do we stop it? well, you don't ignore fbi warnings. for months. you don't ignore their phone calls. you don't refuse to upgrade your security when you're advised to do so.<br/><br/>in other words, you don't arrogantly dismiss the fbi and thereby let the russians in to interfere.<br/><br/>i have a right to demand that. so do you. and you should. <S_SEP> , government ethics i listened to a portion of the hearing and republicans seemed to be threatening anyone who has spoken about this. had there not been leaks, we would have never known about potentially the most devastating act of treason in our history.<br/>also, i'd like to point out how many people in countless agencies are privy to all sorts of classified information. does anyone believe that out of the thousands of people working in intelligence that they are all ethical when we have the most unethical congress and president?<br/>this isn't a joke. we are talking the sort of cyberwar that could take down our grids, hospitals, and countless other things. putin has a clear vision, china has a clear vision, even north korea has a clear vision. we have the tweet in chief who seems hell bent on sucking everything he can for his personal gain. i ask the citizens of america, when a few completely dismantle our country, where will you be standing? how long before they come to think you're a spoil on their idea of this country? <S_SEP> , russia and election the sensible folks in fly-over land don't believe the russians hacked the election.<br/><br/>the left can continue this nonsensical push to try to desperately find a link where putin somehow gave trump the presidency for as long as they like.<br/><br/>all it does is turn us off and make us realize how hopeless the left is. <S_SEP> how would this work if the fbi finds collusion between the trump administration and the russians, exactly?<br/><br/>if pence is found to not be part of this, i guess he becomes president. if he is part of it, i guess he can't be vp or president.<br/><br/>next in line is the speaker of the house, paul ryan. oh gawd...<br/><br/>next is sen. orrin hatch, president pro tem of the senate. he is the least scary of the four. how did we get ourselves into this mess? <S_SEP> here's what worries me the most. what if donald trump is just a fool who idolizes putin and his kleoptocracy? so a little bit of everything is true. he has done business with russians, but not putin's regime directly. he learned that putin was interested in aiding his campaign, so he egged him on with kind words but no explicit collusion. and ideologically and politically he has found a mentor. all of these things together could be devastating for the country and he may not have broken the law. then we just drift towards a shady, manipulated, autocratic united states of trump for 4 years ? <br/><br/>i don't understand why republicans wouldn't do everything in their power to protect pence and impeach trump. maybe that's harder than it sounds? <S_SEP> there is an assault on the normal procedures of government, and if it is left unchecked we will do unprecedented harm to our institutions. from mcconnell's abandonment of his constitutional duty to advise and consent to trump's wholesale dismemberment of important governmental agencies, to undoing of treaties and agreements, to unfounded allegations, the list is a disturbing one.<br/>we need an immediate and impartial investigation to re-establish a sense of order and credibility in government. <S_SEP> , partisanship of the fbi while you say, "there is no reason to doubt mr. comey's commitment" to finding the truth about potential collusion between the trump campaign and russian operatives, his very intrusion in the campaign that many feel grievously wounded secretary clinton is clear reason to doubt his objectivity. the partisanship already on display along with the heavy tweeting fingers of the president and his equally suspect attorney general who has already lied about his contacts with russian officials make the quest for truth and justice by the fbi equally suspect. we absolutely must have a nonpartisan, independent special prosecutor appointed for trust to be restored and the darkening clouds hanging over our democracy removed. <S_SEP> , russians and gop look. people. it's simple. really. if republicans were serious about the russian connection there is a quick and easy way to get to the truth. they would simply subpoena the people involved, manafort, flynn, et al - i would include trump in this group - and force them to testify under oath before a select committee. <br/><br/>since there is so much lying going on in trump-land, i'm pretty sure most of them would end up in prison either for collusion or lying to congress - again, including mr. trump - but hey, at least we got them off the streets. <S_SEP> to what is really galling is the republican in congress support trump more than the country. against russia of all countries to support. <br/><br/>but even more worries are what they will do in the future. will they support more investigations if (really when) russia begins to create more overt ways to change politics in america. what will they do if russia is found to be able to change votes in elections? how many of them are "bought off" by money and/or power. <br/><br/>there is no question that russia will continue to try to influence our elections, our body politics to advance their ideals. we had better be very aware and ready for that when it comes. <S_SEP> i have been caught with two very haunting past events: the watergate hearings and a movie entitled hunting of a president. in the first, this national found the truth about a president. in the second, we can discover how hatreds can run deep and do this country an injustice. we can find a special prosecutor who can't let go for the better interests of this country. i do not insinuate that is the case now. it is clear that this president does not understand his role and we have little in the way of leadership in the house and senate. until those in leadership can step forward and lead we are never going to discover what we need to know. russia was invasive and at least those who can help protect us can do their jobs. we now need those who have accepted the role of defending the constitution to do what is necessary to that end. we need another sam irvin to ask the real questions and to take a lead. until that happens the president will continue to throw out chaos and continue to attack anyone he fears or dislikes. it takes leadership to safe-guard our democracy at this point. we have to recognize that will not come from where it should. <S_SEP> on the first day of spring, it felt liberating to hear the truth that trump's accusation against obama for wiretapping him was invalid. to know that comey and the fbi have been investigating russia's role in hacking cinton's emails to favor one candidate will, if conducted with forbearance, also yield the truth. how are we to prevent our adversaries from impacting our democratic institutions if our own congress won't tell the truth? how dare they try to act as if the real problem are the leakers rather than the contents of what has been leaked: that there are those put into powerful positions by trump that have helped to undermine our election process by being putin's patsies.<br/>we must demand an independent select committee that has subpoena power to get to the bedrock of truth. enough with the republicans'attempt to cover up what is staring us all in the face: that the public trust has been betrayed by those purported to uphold it. thank you adam schaffer for your eloquent analysis of the russian connection. now let's get to the work of shoring up our republic by finding out the truth. <S_SEP> has anyone been able to cite even one non-criminal explanation for trump's bizarre fawning over putin?<br/>exactly whose votes was a nativist right-wing candidate courting by effusively praising the leader of russia?<br/>the man who vowed to "make america great again" will go down as the biggest traitor in american history. <S_SEP> it is high time for the us senate to issue a subpoena for trump's tax and business records. this is no longer a political issue, this is a national security concern. it is becoming more and more apparent that trump is, as many reports have said for months, somehow indebted to the russians and putin, or worse, is compromised. the controversial "dossier", with its reports of financial and salacious activity has been largely ignored since its reveal, now looks like it might be more accurate than suspected. we truly have a crisis of the highest order before us, and that is not hyperbole. we cannot allow a person to hold the office of president who is beholden to, indebted to, ingratiated to, or in any way susceptible to foreign influence. this is no laughing matter. he may be a "manchurian candidate", whether he knows it or not, and we need to know the truth. <S_SEP> ok. democracy moves slowly. i get it. but this is ridiculous if not disasterous. a month in a trump presidency feels like a decade of calamity.<br/>everyone except the most avid alt right trump supporters should have seen what and who trump was the moment he appeared on the stage amid all the others vying to be the republican candidate for president. he was and is totally unfit for the office.....any office.<br/>the. " circumstantial" evidence is screaming the truth about the russian connections. and probably has been since last july. the republicans in congress need to get a spine and think about the country for once....and not their own reelection 24/7. this administration's goal of deconstructing the government, if achieved, might mean there is no more election for anyone anyway. elections are not so popular in authoritarian states. <S_SEP> america is at a dead halt until an independent prosecutor is appointed to investigate and eliminate all russian operatives in our wh and gop government. nothing will happen. nothing will get done. the sooner the opponents of this investigation get out of the way, the sooner they will stop looking like guilty collaborators. <S_SEP> based upon their committee questions yesterday, it's clean the trump gop congress put party above country and seeking distract from their leader's possible collusion with russia. an independent investigation is needed.
avoid the russian/republican word game traps.<br/><br/>not all "leaks" are equal, and in this case the leaks fall under the rubric of whistleblowing. <br/><br/>government sources are doing a great service to their country by shedding light on russian hanky panky and republic collusion. "leaks" are not the problem here. don't let republicans distort what's at issue. <S_SEP> president trump is not under investigation. read the transcript of the hearing instead of relying on the biased nyt editorial board's interpretation. i gues the nyt is just fine with the criminal activities of the leakers. <S_SEP> trump's desperate attempt to save his skin by dismissing his team's possible collusion with russia, calling the allegations “fake news” and his frantic appeal to congress and the fbi to drop the case are clear indications that he doesn't have a clean conscience. or else he would "want this matter to be fully investigated as quickly and as transparently as possible." after all it's about his place in history and the republicans' integrity as a political party.<br/>besides americans have the right to know that their president has nothing sinister to hide. and his government has to ensure that last year's election was fair and transparent. that trump seeks to distract public attention from the fbi investigations and insists on finding who had leaked to the press, is unwise. anyone with a modicum of common sense would see that an investigation into whether his team had colluded with russia has priority over identifying the leaker, who had the nation's interest at heart. <S_SEP> like a loyal soldier flynn fell on the sword. it is imperative that congress create an independent commission and subpoena all the players, such as flynn, manafort, bannon, miller, page, etc. and require them to testify under oath. the republican controlled congress cannot be trusted to fully flesh out all the facts. trump's inane attempts to obscure the facts have been dismissed by his own party. it's time to stop covering up and start fessing up. releasing his 2005 income tax return doesn't cut it. the public deserves to see all of his tax returns and hear testimony from everyone involved in this russian scheme. republican legislators are reluctant to expose trump because they see him as the pen who will sign their bills into law. but their integrity is on the line if they aren't willing to pursue the truth. <S_SEP> i think despite their brave faces gop leaders, secretly believe that trump colluded with the russians. that is why they are so furiously trying to turn the issue on it's head by focusing on the illegality of the leaks.<br/><br/>by the way, this is a 180 degree turn from when the dnc leaks were coming out. at that time, they said over and over, that the media should focus on what was in the leaks and worry about the illegality less. whatever happened to that? <S_SEP> i think we would all do well to remember that the russians did not write the hacked emails. no one is alleging that the emails have been fabricated. if hilary and podesta and her cronies hadn't written the emails, there would be no story.<br/>furthermore, i seem to be the only one that finds it hypocritical that we covertly listen to phone calls of the russian ambassador, but complain when we find that the russians are hacking our emails. we both spy on each other...some shock! where is the media outrage over our actions? apparently there are no complaints when illegal actions by our government, and the illegal leaking of the phone calls result in the resignation of a republican national security adviser. what happened to balance in media? <S_SEP> , russians' hacking of the dnc the thing is that we know that the russian engaged in hacking the dnc and dumping the information to wiki leaks in an effort to damage clinton. it would also seem that there were an unusual number of communications between the russians and members of the trump campaign team. this does not mean there was collusion. these communications may have been initiated by the russians, but it would seem likely at the very least that the russian were hoping for some beneficial considerations in return for their unsolicited attacks on clinton. in any case we need to understand in detail what went on, what the russians did, and why there were so many communications. even if the trump campaign is totally innocent, we need to know how the russians were trying to use them. <S_SEP> i find it both disturbing and odd that republicans focus on the leaks and are upset by them. seems like they thought leaks were perfectly okay when they were about clinton. besides the fact that those leaks were the only way the u.s. public knew that michael flynn, with one of the most powerful positions in the administration had ties to russia. would republicans have rather buried that fact? <S_SEP> while fbi dir comey confirmed an 8-month investigation of the trump campaign and links to russia, so far it has found nothing. on his last day in office, fmr dir of nat’l intell gen. clapper said on jan 20th he also had seen no evidence of any russia-trump collusion. fmr cia dir morell, who was a surrogate for the clinton campaign, said he had seen no “spark” between the trump campaign and russia. however, the real crime unearthed is that someone in govt released or “leaked” to the media a fisa authorized wiretap of a call between an american citizen, gen. michael flynn and the russian ambassador. comey was asked if it could have been susan rice, ben rhodes, loretta lynch. comey would not commit to investigate these leaks of which are punishable up to 10yrs in prison. <S_SEP> i guess trump's tweets and actions to bury an investigation answer this question: "if mr. trump’s assertion that there was no collusion between his campaign officials and the russian government is true, he should want this matter to be fully investigated as quickly and as transparently as possible." <S_SEP> is there a link between a couple of republican congressmen's hearings, majority leader, wikileaks. v. 'putin' , and trump. what... coincidences on wikileak.. leaks? <S_SEP> the republicans have changed the subject of collusion to leaks. deft as usual. as long as they continue to support donald trump they are collaborators, as well. <S_SEP> "but in his column nicholas kristof provides evidence that the fbi snooping occurred."....you need to understand that russian communications are closely monitored and with good reason. any russian communication they may have had with the trump campaign would be subject to wire tap. this does not mean that the trump campaign was wire tapped, but rather that the russian side of the communication was. the trump campaign may not have colluded with the russians, but that does not mean the russians did not hope that the trump campaign would look at them favorably for their attacks on clinton. <S_SEP> “the republicans who run the senate and the f.b.i.’ will not pursue investigations unless patriotic leakers and journalists make sure the truth comes out. <S_SEP> did the russians set things up so it will look to investigators as though the trump proper colluded? whether they colluded or it just looks like they did, the russians can blackmail trump either way. on the other hand, trump could say he's been set up, even if collusion did actually take place. the facts may be hard to determine and the public will be hard to convince.. <S_SEP> the sides have switched.<br/><br/>when it was about hillary, republicans wanted to talk about the contents of the leaks, and the democrats were outraged about the source.<br/><br/>now it is about trump, the democrats want to talk about the contents of the leaks, and the republicans are outraged about the source.<br/><br/>yet they are closely linked. the contents of trump now are about the source of the hillary leaks. who was it, and what was the motive.<br/><br/>in that sense the democrats are still in their original position, talking about the source of the hillary leaks -- truthful and damning, but beside the point because putin putin. <br/><br/>republicans now are on both sides, scattered. they want to talk about only the substance of the first leaks and the source of the second leaks.<br/><br/>neither side is honest with us. our election was awful, and it is not getting any better. <S_SEP> the question and answer lies in why an investigation happy congress does not want an investigation into trump's ties with russia and meetings with russian operatives during the campaign. they are afraid of what an investigation would reveal and how it would affect their own interests and are hoping all will blow over. <br/><br/>however, this volcano will erupt as day by day the caldon is growing and pressure mounting with each new leak.<br/><br/>when it does, it will blow the lid off the gop's complicity in not pursuing the truth in the face of so many serious clues pointing to trump's treasonous alliance with putin....and the heat they feel will be the disintegration of the republican party. <S_SEP> at some point in either the house or senate investigation a witness will assert his fifth amendment rights. it could be flynn, manafort or some lesser trump campaign apparatchik. at that moment the scheme will begin to unravel rapidly and the one-voice republicans will scramble to find safe harbor. <S_SEP> republicans, focusing on leaks, are playing into the hands of the russians and providing cover for the kremlin. their politics goes against the overweighing national interest. <S_SEP> my issue with republicans is that there reaction makes me wonder how deep their collusion goes. what do they know and when did they know it? how many are actually involved in these back door dealings? how many know that trump and company are guilty, yet toe the party line? i'm sick and tired of this behavior. i want them to focus on the criminal activity of the administration. if there's a need, they can investigate the leaks later.... <S_SEP> watching yesterday's hearings, republicans showed no interest in the fact that russia interfered with our elections. they behaved like getaway drivers and not like patriots concerned for our country. without an independent investigation, america can never trust any conclusion the gop reaches.
spot on! the fbi knew about the russian cyber-attacks by july, 2016 and failed to mention it when comey so helpfully told the nation, two weeks before the election, all about what might be on anthony weiner's computer. when comey did this he completely compromised the fbi. then there is jeff sessions. who believes sessions is not meddling in this mess to try to save his own skin? the man has already amply demonstrated his lack of integrity. an independent investigation is essential. thanks to the gop, every other investigatory option is compromised. <S_SEP> , russia and ny times "there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment." you have got to be kidding. over the last year both democrats and republicans have called him everything but an outright liar with no credibility to a totally incompetent hack. and there is some justification for both of those assessments. since he can be fired at any moment by president trump, he is the last person one should count on to do an impartial investigation of russia/trump ties. his raison d'etre seems to be keep enough partisan balls in the air that nobody will actually fire him. but he is clearly less incompetent at secretive invesstigations than his most famous and infamous predecessor, j. edgar hoover, who had so much information on so many presidents that he lasted more than 30 years on the job. <br/><br/>i have absolutely no confidence in whatever comey says or does and i am surprised that the ny times has such a short memory. talk is cheap and that is comey's stock in trade. whom he hurts or helps seems to be entirely random. <S_SEP> , ukraine affair so, comey has now admitted that they have been investigating the trumputin machine and were doing so before the election. he even intimated that they meddled in the election by "leaking" news detrimental to mrs. clinton's campaign. how he said this with a straight face considering the meddling and leaking that he himself did is disgusting.<br/><br/>maybe the special prosecutor should investigate both comey and trumputin! <S_SEP> i'm afraid i don't trust comey. good for him for saying yes there is an investigation, but he showed very flawed judgement during the election. with a straight face, he testified that he wouldn't discuss details of any investigation until it was complete. and yet that is exactly what he did right before the election. another loose cannon? we need a hero. <S_SEP> very close-mouthed, is comey. can't comment on ongoing investigations, at least not too much. <br/><br/>had he not blabbed every inconsequential detail of mrs. clinton's ongoing investigation, right up to a week before the election, we might have been spared the dangerous -- and calculated -- antics of trump.<br/><br/>(too be fair, mrs. clinton's campaign strategy was misguided. but had she won, we wouldn't have to listen, every day, to lies aimed at revving up the worst elements of american society and at diverting attention from the maneuverings of a conservative agenda that will imperil all of us.) <S_SEP> , impartial investigation, fbi chief, trump aide sessions is crucial to all this: he is the boss if the fbi, sits on the wh national security council, was the first senator to endorse trump, had stephen miller as a top staff member, and more. it will be vey very hard to get an impartial investigation and the full evidence with sessions in this position, even if he is recused from leading it directly. <S_SEP> cannot trust comey entirely. he blew the wrong whistle on hillary but kept mum about trump's coterie. there really needs to be a totally independent prosecutor who will get to the bottom of all the issues, ties with russia, idiocy of tweets about taps, even the leak issue. there should be a full review of many years of taxes as part of this. too much smoke not to have some fire, no matter how low the flame may be at present. <S_SEP> since we now know that there is a criminal probe, there should be no hesitation in invoking the special prosecutor law. the trump team has already tried to meddle in the fbi and the cia, by trying to get them to push back against the media stories.<br/><br/>maybe comey's statement today was intended to bring about the appointment of a special prosecutor. <S_SEP> , fbi, russia and election "there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment." ... ? what an odd comment given comey's rush to announce his reopening of the clinton email non-case while concealing his investigation of trump's ties to russia knowing full well their involvement in election dirty tricks. comey himself destroyed the fbi's credibility for me. your conclusion is exactly correct: only an independent prosecutor (not a limp-wristed, foot-dragging commission) can bring justice in this tragic mess. <S_SEP> the trump administration will welcome comey's efforts to investigate the russia incursion into us electoral politics. since trump's chumps did nothing wrong, the investigation will exonerate them fully. complete cooperation is the order of the day.<br/><br/>or they could bomb north korea. <S_SEP> , public statement of an investigation strange, but it seems like just a few months ago, comey was the enemy of free elections, having made declarations, insinuating hitherto unknown illegal activities by hillary clinton. now, he has become the champion of democracy, investigating the winner of the election, donald trump and his associates. is it normal for a fbi director to state publicly that someone is being investigated? wouldn't it be more appropriate to conduct the investigation in secrecy and only come out if charges are going to be laid? comey seems like a very able politician, playing one side of the isle, and now the other. <S_SEP> comey should recuse himself for his remaining tenure when politics are incolved <S_SEP> it can't be sessions who gave approval for comey to comment on fbi investigation of russian connection. sessions has supposedly "recused" himself. it would make no sense if it were sessions. he would have a plausible excuse for not giving permission--revealing an ongoing investigation. then the question becomes who did give permission? <S_SEP> what mccarthyism on a made-up story. the editors don't like the major change in policy that is coming in the mideast and nato where they are decades out of date, so they say trump is a russian agent.<br/><br/>but at least they could reread what they said about comey's investiation and statements about hillary before the election. he has become fully politicized and is simply trying to shift blame from the days when the times et al said that he was the one who defeated hillary, not the russians.<br/><br/>comey should be fired. the two parties should get together and find someone they can agree on unanimously as fbi head who is a real professional and will take it out of the political morass where comey has put it. <S_SEP> comey stated the fbi started the trump investigation back in the summer of 2016 but only came forward to the public on the clinton email scandal just before the election?<br/>the email press conference with no comment on russian involvement seems a total imbalance of transparency at this point. <S_SEP> comey said repeatedly that the fact that someone is targeted in an investigation for possible wrongdoing does not imply their guilt. genuine justice works slowly and discreetly, preserving the presumption of innocence and allowing for any eventual trial to feature a robust defense of the accused and an impartial judgment. we all were aghast at the unfairness of the repeated inquiries into secretary clinton's supposed misdeeds on benghazi. why should we now abandon our values and conduct a politicized public inquisition? mike morrell, a recently retired cia acting director and strong clinton backer, has predicted that there will be no fire at the end of the day on collusion with russia, despite all the smoke. your article and reporting never acknowledge that this outcome of a fair investigation is possible. <S_SEP> as our new attorney general, jeff sessions declines to recuse himself from investigations into russian collaboration with the trump campaign, of which he was a member, we cluck our tongues and assume that someone with the capacity to make a change will eventually protest. when he refuses to seek an indictment for former nsa michael flynn over his lying to the fbi we accept it as the new normal.<br/><br/>if our justice department is compromised we must rely on the vigilance of the press to keep us informed, as the republican led house and senate have proven that they have no interest in anything other than their own selfish agenda. what would previously have been shameful has become routine.<br/><br/>the common thread is the same as it has always been; greed, which has risen to the level of religion. all debate over the reasons for our dilemma can be distilled into that single word. the ideological masses on one side or the other ebb and flow like the tides, straining against each other while those in power look down in amusement at the effects of their subterfuge.<br/><br/>we can make a difference, as long as we remain focused and resolute. i will continue to hold my sign, joining my brethren in the only religion worth following: the truth. <S_SEP> are we a bunch of rubes? so fbi director comey who blatantly tipped the scales of the election is now going to seriously investigate russian involvement in the election? how dumb do they think we all are?<br/><br/>clearly, they believe we are pretty dumb. nothing less than a special prosecutor will answer here. they are all singing from the same hymnbook, this is kabuki theater. we must demand a special prosecutor. i nominate preet bharara. <S_SEP> the fbi is under the auspices of the justice department. a.g. sessions has supposedly recused himself. does anyone honestly think that recusal means anything in this nefarious administration? i applaud comey and the fbi for their efforts to get at the truth.<br/><br/>leaks are a part of government and in trump's administration provide a window on what is the most corrupt administration since nixon's and even his pales in comparison. watergate was domestic and the upcoming "trumpgate" may reveal collusion with our most formidable adversary led by a former intelligent agent. wake up, america, you've been conned. <S_SEP> james comey should be investigated.
more suspicious details that need to be investigated: <br/><br/>1. page 30 of the dossier: trump is promised 19% of russian oil company rosneft in exchange for eliminating the sanctions.<br/><br/>2. jan. 2017, 19.5% of rosneft is secretly sold but with so many shell companies impossible to tell to whom.<br/><a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight-iduskbn1582oh" title="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight-iduskbn1582oh" target="_blank">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-rosneft-privatisation-insight-i...</a><br/><br/>3. exxon mobil, under rex tillerson (now trump's sec. of state), brokered a deal with russia in 2013 to lease over 60 million acres of russian land to pump oil out of (5x as much land as they lease in us), but all that russian oil would go through pipelines in the ukraine, which heavily taxes the proceeds. putin invades ukraine in 2014 and secured the routes to export the oil tax-free by sea. after obama sanctioned russia for the invasion, exxon mobil could only pump oil from approximately 3 of those 60+ million acres. the russian government’s oil company, rosneft, will make half a trillion dollars from that much untapped oil, all pumped tax-free through crimea, stolen from ukraine, now owned by russia. putin may have subverted our government just for this deal to go through. <S_SEP> to be more specific: our now secretary of state (sos), rex tillerson, as ceo of exxon inked a deal with russia's largest oil company rosneft to provide exxon fracking and oil sands extraction for the northwest siberian oil fields which have an estimated 625 million tons of oil yet to be extracted. the deal is, as you correctly pointed out, worth $500 billion with exclusive rights for exxon (over bp, chevron, etc.) for a percentage of the oil extracted, worth more than a trillion. tillerson inked this deal against the wishes of the state department (i.e., hillary) because the u.s. had (still does) placed sanctions on the russians. but rosneft needs the technology and tillerson went ahead anyway. regardless, if any displaced coal workers are looking for a job, learn russian and get a (one way) ticket to siberia. in any case, comey and our independent investigative committee, if it ever comes to be, should simply follow the money (to prirazlomnoy) <S_SEP> , russia and exxon another dot, more like a blot. $500 billion deal with russia's oil giant gazprom inked by secretary of state rex tillerson 2 years ago while still ceo at exxon. deal is for exxon to provide oil technology in return to a portion of oil reserves in northern siberia. tillerson went ahead with the deal despite violating dept of state sanctions imposed by then hillary clinton. exxon and putin needed her out so they can relax the sanctions and allow the deal to move forward. trump was simply the unwitting means to that end.<br/><br/>regardless, there's no way trump can match wits with the crafty, ex-kgb agent putin who controls the strings on our potus (puppet in chief of the united states). <S_SEP> carter page is the rosetta stone for this cipher.<br/><br/>in january 2017 page was under investigation by the fbi, cia, nsa, odni, and fincen. his ties to russian state-owned oil companies allows him to operate in an undisclosed financial world where lifting sanctions unlock hundreds of billions of dollars.<br/><br/>mr. page quoted on his travels to russia on december 12, 2106,<br/>"i had the opportunity to meet with some of the top managers of the company rosneft. the recent rosneft deal, in which the qatar fund and glencore could take part is, unfortunately, a good example of how american private companies are limited to a great degree due to the influence of sanctions."<br/><br/>the background details of this deal are questionable. "rosneft declined to respond to questions posed by reuters, including a request for comment on how ownership of the 19.5 percent stake was divided, information about the identity of the cayman islands buyer, or details of the source of any undisclosed sources of funds. the kremlin did not respond to a list of questions about the deal sent by reuters."<br/><br/>the smoking gun is in plain site of everyone. when trump lifts sanctions billions flood into russia, namely the deal pending for exxonmobile as architected by secretary of state, rex tillerson, who was a director of the joint us-russian oil company exxon neftegas.<br/><br/>the same tillerson who was awarded 2013 the order of friendship by putin for his contribution to deloping cooperation in the energy sector. game, set, match. <S_SEP> here is part of the web connect the dots : how russian oil giant rosneft could claim u.s. oil<br/><a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rosneft-russian-oil-could-claim-us-oil-trump-cfius/" title="http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rosneft-russian-oil-could-claim-us-oil-trump-cfius/" target="_blank">http://www.cbsnews.com/news/rosneft-russian-oil-could-claim-us-oil-trump...</a> <S_SEP> , relation between usa and russia to me, the most disturbing news of the day is the report that tillerson is skipping the nato meeting and going to russia instead.<br/><br/>if true, it seems to verify not only collusion but the existence of a quid pro quo, or many - one of the most obvious being increased cooperation between exxon and rossneft, free of interference from the epa and other american constraints both to defend our sovereignty and protect our environment, particularly in the arctic and the gulf.<br/><br/>this aspect alone makes us look like the victims of a hostile takeover by rossneft/exxon. maybe we should take down old glory and run up the exxon sign instead? <br/><br/>the wholesale abandonment of principle and history encapsulated by a simultaneous attack on nato and an embrace of russia is staggering, unprecedented and doesn't reflect american values at all, nor our post wwii defense strategy which has worked well, nor our historic links to western europe.<br/><br/>something is very rotten in denmark. we must have an independent counsel as soon as possible. the gop members of that committee, except for ileana ros-lehtinen, was distressingly focused on leaks instead of crimes and even tried to drag hillary clinton into the mess. therefore they can't be counted on to be rigorous and fair in their investigation either.<br/><br/>the sooner we get an independent investigation the better. one feels our very fabric stressed every time "potus" tweets or holds forth at a rally - the lies alone are untenable. <S_SEP> please add the possibility that russia is bribing trump to your financial support scenario. the steele dossier mentions a payment of a 19% share of rosneft in exchange for lifting sanctions. lo and behold, 19.5% was sold to an unidentified buyer in december. buyer and recipient can't be determined - the deal is hidden in shell companies. <S_SEP> someone else you may already have brought this up, i don't have time to read all these comments this morning. but what leonhardt has left out is the rosneft/exxon theory. that oil deal is worth $500 billion and can't go through unless sanctions are lifted. if trump lifts the sanctions so the theory goes he will be rewarded with $19 billion and rex tillerson also will profit immensely. follow the money! <S_SEP> fascinating. frightening. foreboding. <br/><br/>are we reading a synopsis for the next john le caree or robert ludlam spy novel? while all the elements of fantastical fiction are present, this sheet is real. what's missing is the underlying motive that has propelled the story thus far. this column misses mentioning it also. namely, the half trillion dollar buried treasure of oil reserves under russian arctic waters temporarily kept at arms reach by obama's sanctions. oil reserves that rexxon tillerson's natural resource conglomerate had contracted with putin's oligarchical apparatus to extract. in order for that oil to be shipped/piped to market without taxation by ukraine would require nothing more complex than russian control over crimea. check.<br/><br/>lifting the sanctions would not only unlock the arctic treasure chest but personally pump unimaginable wealth into putin and his cronies personal pockets. the british m6 spy's secret dossier includes the nugget of intelligence that trump will get up to 20% of the proceeds! <br/><br/>need any more reason why trump has stacked his administration with protoputin people? why was pro-russian crimean language forcefully inserted into the republican party platform last july? why flynn was making nice with his russian counterparts the day after obama added more sanctions? why the trump campaign was in "constant contact" with kremlin spies?<br/><br/>if the senate intelligence committee has any guts and brains, they need to ask the right questions. <S_SEP> what about his appointment of rex tillerman as secretary of state? rex and putin go way back as friends and business associates in the oil business. trump did not know rex before now. seems suspicious. <br/><br/> looking forward to more links and dots to connect. <S_SEP> i give you theory number six. he is on the take. russia has promised him a stake in rosneft via qhg cayman ltd if he drops sanctions on russia permitting exports from the $500 billion exxonmobil oil field in the arctic. <S_SEP> , russia and exxon mobil, ukraine and obama sanctions i think you are missing an obvious connection. three things are sure to send washington lurching into action: oil, guns, and money. the bromance with putin has all three. <br/><br/>before russia invaded ukraine, and obama to imposed sanctions on russia, exxon mobil entered into a series of enormous complex reciprocal deals with roseneft, russia's de facto national oil company. it is reasonable to assume that putin personally receives a lot of roseneft's income. in the exxon mobil deal roseneft received interests in us oil reserves and exxon mobil received interests in extensive russian petrochemical reserves. <br/><br/>obama's sanctions threw a monkey wrench into the deals. exxon's losses on the deals since the sanctions are in the billions and still counting. that is why much of the back channel chatter between washington and moscow focused on lifting the obama sanctions. exxon mobil is hurting, and so is roseneft. <br/><br/>follow the oil, follow the money. and then trump appointed the ceo of exxon mobil our secretary of state. <S_SEP> trump's extreme personal and vicious attacks against our intelligence agencies is also bizarre. the down-sizing of the state department is viewed as more quaint, but equally dangerous. trump and associates boldly act as if they are completely immune to any consequences of their endless, public affection of russia and sudden disinterest in diplomatic, foreign engagement. why is tillerson, who ran a small country called exxon mobil, suddenly a ghostly figure, saying nothing? whose world does he run now? russia? <S_SEP> sanctions relief would get russian oil flowing again to help fix russia's economy and grease the skids for large exploration deals with exxon/tillerson. even ethical people can be tempted to make bad deals when billions of dollars are at stake and headed their way. <S_SEP> in addition to owing lots of money to r oligarchs and wanting the naming rights to more buildings in r's sphere of influence, he probably has been promised a cut of the huge wealth that will come to putin and exxon when the sanctions are ended and they take a lot of oil from russian land that exxon invested in but can't develop yet. of course that not only enriches all of them, it also ends our grandkids' ability to live well on this earth. <S_SEP> how about educating yourself before shooting your mouth off. here's the truth about hillary and uranium--the deal would never even have made it to secretary at any of the nine federal agencies involved. try reading this:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/10/26/the-facts-behind-trumps-repeated-claim-about-hillary-clintons-role-in-the-russian-uranium-deal/?utm_term=.b95d88aa472a" title="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/10/26/the-facts-behind-trumps-repeated-claim-about-hillary-clintons-role-in-the-russian-uranium-deal/?utm_term=.b95d88aa472a" target="_blank">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/10/26/the-facts...</a><br/><br/>don't want to believe the washington post, <a href="http://factcheck.org" title="factcheck.org" target="_blank">factcheck.org</a> and politifact either? then you can't be helped. stick with fake fox news. <S_SEP> you forgot the the motive of oil deals, including turning a blind eye toward pipelines through crimea, appointing rex tillerson as secretary of state, and helping exxon drill on the russian arctic.
you're confused. it has never been said that trump wasn't investigated. in fact, we sincerely hope that he has been investigated. the lie is that dt alleged obama was behind the investigation and wiretaps as part of some political agenda. the truth is that it is believed obama never authorized any such investigation and that it was all carried out under the legal authority long held by the fbi, etc. <S_SEP> i can't see how without appointing a special prosecutor we will know the truth of what happened in the 2016 election. and if we never know, the same could, and will happen again. <S_SEP> it´s clear the polarized political situation in congress and the country requires the appointment of a special prosecutor, who has a legal and ethical mandate to conduct a thorough independent investigation. the findings of the investigation should be published in a transparent and timely manner. <S_SEP> can someone help me here? could the results of this investigation jump-start impeachment? <S_SEP> let's get on with an investigation. let the truth come out. let us in particular see the tax returns. my guess: at a minimum, it will be found that trump people and probably trump himself were sending a "no objection" message to russian-engineered leaks aimed at damaging the clinton campaign. that's just a hair from a formal impeachment count. if anything close to coordinated, direct collusion is found, the case for impeachment will be beyond debate. <S_SEP> we absolutely need an independent prosecutor. the gop congressional representatives seemed to tailor their questions to wanting to find who leaked information. this clearly plays trump's game, and shows a lack of concern for our democracy. <S_SEP> , legal procedure i am honestly dumbfounded that there is no legal procedure in place for investigating the types of allegations (high treason) come to light concerning the trump campaign and foreign powers. <S_SEP> big news for the times: an investigation is not an indictment, let alone an condemnation. <S_SEP> i'm in favor of this investigation.<br/><br/>but if russian hacking is as big a threat as it's made out to be, the investigation should include the negligence of the democratic party in allowing it to happen.<br/><br/>the fbi started warning the dnc that they were being hacked by people lnked to russia in sept 2015. warning after warning to increase security was ignored. calls were not returned.<br/><br/>then the leaks were posted, clinton lost the election, and what was dismissed as a nothing problem is now a threat to democracy.<br/><br/>this aspect cannot be ignored. <S_SEP> the only hope i see is rod rosenstein appointing a special prosecutor. in any other scenario, the outcome will be stonewalling, much as we saw at yesterday's house hearing where the only point republicans agreed on was the need to prosecute those revealing the collusion between the trump campaign and the russians. <S_SEP> try to keep up. some republicans (mccain, graham, etc.) even want a solid investigation. <S_SEP> i hope congress examines the timing of this cia leak by assange since it seemed timed to offer trump a lot of cover for his generalizations about surveillance he likes to call "wiretapping" when he's flirting with disaster.<br/><br/>and why not examine the timing of that newcorp blackberry's email's loss of contents before it went before a court, but after it spent a month waiting for its tempora file to be served?<br/><br/>see, i'm not so worried about evidence, as much as evidence that has been perverted or inserted...that trick lost us $2 billion of rupert's kidz' inheritance. protect the fcpa dragon from this siegfried and roy partnership! <S_SEP> if you're counseling the dems to avoid conspiracy theories, read the rest of your column today. it sure reads like a conspiracy theory! fortunately, your bottom line is correct: independent investigation is nedded. <S_SEP> perhaps we will have two investigations.<br/>the first one by the fbi, which will end inconclusively<br/>the second by an independent prosecutor, leading to ???<br/>these should eat up 2 years at least <S_SEP> bottom line is that little will happen unless enough "principled" and "patriotic" gop members of congress join the demand for an independent investigation. i wouldn't hold my breath for this to occur, which is why journalists must keep on digging, leakers keep on leaking, and the public keep on clamoring for the answer to how it came to pass that putin's cyber army was selectively deployed against hrc and the dnc while powwowing with trunp campaign officials. my take is that this is watergate on steroids. <S_SEP> "appointing a special prosecutor would show that mr. sessions is willing to have an impartial examination of his actions as a surrogate for mr. trump last year "<br/><br/>this is no longer sessions' call.
“as a liberal person who has been disbarred because i chose to speak out against the f.b. i. and the justice department in support of my right to free speech, i would caution you in placing all the focus on the president. your paper, the times, addressed the issue of "the deep state" this morning in the daily podcast. the deep state is where the upper-level lifies control what is being leaked to the media, which dutifully reports the leaks to the public, which in turn raises the opposition to people they do not like. in this case that is trump. <br/><br/>the people in control of the deep state, hidden from sight, live by the mantra that their view of things is right because they know better. they have the power to then super-impose their views in secret on us. the leaks are calculated to move the country to support their views. they believe they are true heroes. <br/><br/>the issue with russia and trump is of interest, but notice the timing of each leak, how the media then broadcasts them and in what light, and then see the resulting public reaction, which is now galvanized in a movement to bring trump down no matter what. <br/><br/>the journalists, writers, artists, etc., need to keep your independence and focus some of your energy on the whens, whys, and hows of the leaks and who benefits from them, otherwise, you incredibly important part of the forces that keep this country moving forward are surrendering your power. <S_SEP> at first thought it seems incredulous that trey, trump, and all their sidekicks think americans can't see through their attempts to change the subject of a trump-russian consortium to who did the leaking. but on second thought it is as plain as day they don't care. they'll hammer and hammer and hammer until we just slam the door in complete and utter disgust. that's what they're after. <br/><br/>politicians have always been liars and obfuscators. in the past they had the "integrity" to disguise this behavior. not anymore. they're bold and open and blatant about it now. in the end, americans can do nothing except hang our heads in shame. trey and trump are fine with that. they just don't give a sh... <S_SEP> "what are we doing about the leakers?" the greek chorus of republicans cries in one voice. they do the "one voice" thing really well as an opposition strategy in coordination with their dedicated media outlets like fox news. <br/><br/>but when it comes to taking action, rather than blocking it, they somehow miss choir practice. there is a lot of disharmony over "repeal and replace", now that they actually have to do something constructive, as promised.<br/><br/>while the russia investigation will go on for some time, trump administration credibility on russia is already gone and can't be salvaged. and with it, the us ability to lead the coalition that has successfully contained the soviet union and russia. <br/><br/>trump will get no support for easing sanctions on russia from other members of nato, his first priority. and he will get no support for his russian coordinated middle east strategy, with its escalated bombings of civilians in urban areas like aleppo.<br/><br/>the most unifying concern in the world today is "how do we get rid of trump". how's that for a spontaneous greek chorus? <S_SEP> it’s said wikileaks and the russians are working to undermine and destabilize our govt institutions, to erode public confidence in our govt. and influence elections in underhanded ways. this lets predatory, wealthy power centers undermine the citizen majority’s rights. <br/><br/>but that’s similar to what the rw gop have been doing for years. deliberately weakening govt to increase the power of corporations who subsidize their campaigns. and interfering with voting rights, and flooding the media with fake news, paranoia and resentment. <br/><br/>this laid the groundwork for the unstable, authoritarian trump, who is now intensifying same. then displacing blame. we have both foreign and internal enemies. we live in interesting times as they say. <S_SEP> so why do times reporters thrush and haberman accept as normal and unremarkable that all of the republican intelligence committee members see their jobs as "building a case for the president?" these elected officials are putting their party before the well being of the country. the question is whether trump has committed treason but preserving republican control comes first. <br/><br/>this is not normal and no times reporter should accept it as such. we should see no more articles on deals between trump's children and china that don't point out that these deals are extraordinary breaches of the constitution. <S_SEP> , gowdy, clinton emails, russia and election today was a sad day for american democracy. the revelations by mr.comey throw a big question mark on the fidelity of the 2016 elections. during the campaign mr.trump openly praised russia's hacking capabilities and whether in jest or not invited them to solve mrs. clinton's email muddle. mr. trump expressed doubt about our electoral process and said he loved leaks. after winning by electoral votes but trailing by 3 million popular votes he accused widespread voter fraud. now after his wire tapping charge is found to be baseless he is wanting the source of leaks investigated. while mr.comey's sincerity to conduct a proper investigation cannot be doubted, his own pre election performance was anything but stellar. if he was duty bound to inform congress of finding mrs. clinton's emails in disgraced ex congressman mr. weiner's computer, he must similarly have been duty bound to inform on her major opponent's team's potential collusion with russia. one wonders why the difference in handling the two issues? if a theft occurs one needs to find the thief first not why the robbery occurred. but that clearly is what trey gowdy and the gop are doing. <S_SEP> what i don't understand is the news media. i followed the campaign closely and was aghast at the plain view interaction of trump and his team with the russians, from several members of his team traveling to russia, to financial ties there with manafort, questions about flynn, already finished transactions that had various people associated with russia buying trump properties. it was all out there. yet, one or two articles would appear and then the subject would be dropped. where were you guys? <br/><br/>beyond that, why was trump given a pass on his penchant for lying? that character flaw was out there too. i want a presidential candidate that has the intellectual heft to handle the job, yet he had demonstrated over and over that he was woefully ill equipped to do this job and was given a pass by the press. there was no meat on his agenda and was still talked about seriously as if he did have solid plans. inexplicable! <br/><br/>now is the time to redeem yourselves. go for it. dig up every fact, every connection and don't white wash it before you print it. a large segment of america would like to think the country we love is still functioning on some level. let's make it the press and give us the meat we lacked during the campaign. <S_SEP> thank god for the leaker(s). for if the president is truly crazy, what is to be done but to try to expose this? leaking would not be necessary if there were more patriots in congress... <S_SEP> i hope your column today causes a course correction by our most powerful and wide reaching news providers, of which the nyt leads. the tendency continues to be that of getting caught up in the latest outrage (which occur at least daily and sometimes hourly) with this swamp monster government we now have to endure.<br/>i have thought all along that the likelieast way to get out of this mess is through russia. it is a place where the left and right find common ground.<br/>back in february, trump accused the intelligence community of illegally leaking information leading to questions about his ties to russia, a senior intellingence officer's tweet was retweeted by the recipient in the intellgence community, it stated "he will die in jail". this is chilling to read. what do they know or suspect and when will we have any republican acquiescence for a thorough airing of information? until then we are left to wonder and fret about our country's future. and frankly it makes me think that some of these other serious matters won't continue to matter.<br/>focus must remain on the questions you raise because the specter of treason is in them. <S_SEP> the fact that trump calls every public challenge or criticism "fake news" proves two points.<br/><br/>1) that he, a practiced liar and boastful aggressor, quietly understands that his administration and his career have been built on cheating, on "alternative facts." is it time to feel guilty and reform? nope. it's time to counter-punch. hit back hard. problem with this strategy? the childish tactic is getting boring, repetitive, predicable, and is obviously desperate. sad.<br/><br/>2) the guy loves four-letter words. <S_SEP> heartening to see many republicans put the focus on leakers rather than the prospective criminal acts of the trump administration itself.<br/><br/>much like drug pushers, they are more concerned with snitches than they crimes committed and lives ruined by the "product." <S_SEP> every tweet is evidence of panic.<br/>every rally is a last hurrah.<br/>every russian connection is a liability.<br/>every conspirator is one who will take a deal with the fbi for immunity.<br/>every day is one day closer to the end. <br/><br/>pence, you gonna use the same bible as last time? better keep it handy. in the meantime, keep your distance. stay out of the implosion. just watch from afar. it will be majestic. <S_SEP> to flesh out kristof's offering here read:<br/> <a href="http://billmoyers.com/story/dig-deep-russia-love-money/" title="http://billmoyers.com/story/dig-deep-russia-love-money/" target="_blank">http://billmoyers.com/story/dig-deep-russia-love-money/</a><br/>"dig deep: from russia with love money"<br/>by gail ablow | march 6, 2017<br/><br/>rachel maddow — nails down inescapable conclusions.<br/><br/>politifact — runs down the dots more comprehensively<br/><br/> i find it galling that the times with all its resources can't get the documented facts out and do a better job of lining up indisputable logic. if nothing else read the bill moyers article, it is jaw dropping.
, a nominated deputy what do you expect out of the investigations with a nominated deputy who is still under trump's thumb and a doj staffed with only republican prosecutors ??<br/><br/>we need an independent special prosecutor. <S_SEP> sessions role was simply to protect trump by controlling and deflecting any justice dept investigations. that's why trump did an atomic melt-down when sessions recused himself. <S_SEP> clear evidence that congress's intelligence commission cannot possibly provide the independent investigation so clearly needed comes not just from yesterday's embarrassing parade of leak-hunters but out of committee member peter king's own mouth, complaining of trump's tweets: “[the tweets] put us on defense all the time when we could be building a case for the president.” he clearly views his and his fellow republicans' role as being counsel for the defense -- the very opposite of the investigator needed. <S_SEP> i assume that jeff sessions will do whatever he can to shut down any investigations. <S_SEP> the founding fathers must be rolling! this is not the experiment they set out on. more importantly than this looney as potus, is the failure of bipartisanship, and the clear message both sides now operate under-'party before patriotism'. any member of congress who votes against an investigation and special prosecutor will hopefully be voted out in 2018. <S_SEP> of course the recusal of mr. sessions is an entirely inadequate solution if the goal is avoiding conflicts. one step that the senate can take if they will not appoint an independent counsel is to hold off appointing any other staff to the doj so that any deputies who remain are hold-overs and, at least are less beholden to the current administration, though they must still tangle with sessions as their boss.<br/><br/>one last thought concerns the ridiculous tweeting. an adult with modest self-control and self-awareness, and with even passing knowledge of the constitution might have censored him or herself by this point, in order to make use of the fifth amendment. with any luck for the country, mr. trump will sink his own ship with these tweets. to my mind, the screaming tweets about leakers are an example, for as others have noted, why worry about leakers if there is no truth to the leaked information? <S_SEP> if only all supposed presidential mis steps had an fbi inquiry assigned to them. <br/><br/>kudos to the current holder for letting the investigation go on. <S_SEP> trump and his team now deserve to be investigated by an independent counsel with the single-minded partisan tenacity of a ken starr. the depth and breadth of his/her brief should be no less intrusive than was allowed in the starr enquiry. <S_SEP> there is evidence of coordination. please read malcolm nance's book, "the plot to hack america," which came out two months prior to the 2016 election. nearly everything he demonstrates in the book has come to pass. nance is a former u.s. naval intelligence agent. he also wrote a book about how to defeat isis, and trump allegedly wanted to meet with him before the inauguration. however, after having seen trump's disdain for the intelligence community, nance refused. nance is often a guest on radio and tv shows (e.g., msnbc, cnn, etc.), and had been during the campaign. the book left me petrified about the future of our country and the constitution. it is a worse scandal that watergate; i have lived through both. just read the book. <S_SEP> we're not defending corruption, which is why we want trump investigated. trump makes clinton look like a saint. every new yorker know this. he is as crooked as the day is long. i am not looking for vindication on clinton, that is done and in the past. i want that traitorous know nothing out of office and for that i am willing to risk president pence. think about that for a minute and then pull your head out of the sand. <S_SEP> anyone who still views the trump administration as having any credibility is delusional. a special prosecutor is essential to the task of an actual independent investigation that will follow the evidence to where it leads. <S_SEP> it cannot realistically be a surprise to anyone that there are leaks in this investigation. the inquiry has been going on for eight months, it has spanned a change in the executive branch and has been new administration disparage the investigative community and attempt to seat cabinet members who have lied to congress. through all the bluster about how terrible the leaks are we cannot forget that before there were leaks there was an investigation. <S_SEP> my recollection is that loretta lynch recused herself. as for the irs, they looked into many questionable organizations filing for tax exemptions, both liberal and conservative. this current criminal investigation if the trump campaign team's involvement with russia, while they hacked into the dnc , for the purpose of putting trump in the white house is ten times more serious than watergate. we americans need to understand the gravity of this investigation and what it means for our democracy. rep. adam schiff is not going to allow republican members on the committee sidestep this matter. i have full confidence in him.
thank you! i completely agree.<br/><br/>in my view the potential illegitimacy of this "resident" means that every single appointment, including pence as vp, is in question. <br/><br/>we need to stop right where we are. get a special prosecutor appointed and put the fate of the republic front and center. no more dismantling of protections, no more e is creating of government departments, entities, employees.<br/><br/>we seem to be poised on a precipice. i am simply terrified - as an elderly person with a slowly dying husband, who thankfully still has his mind, so we can discuss politics and inevitably losing each other.<br/><br/>but losing our republic? no!<br/><br/>if things just go on as they are, then we are already on a slippery, downhill slope. and if that continues, i still have the wherewithal to leave the country. but do you? seriously ask yourself that question. is it worth "fighting" for? i dearly hope so! at my age i hate the thought of widowhood and leaving the us. but realistically, i've considered my options. and have my escape route planned. (drive north to canada. then east to my cousin's. till i can get a flight to spain, where my husband's family will take me in. ("activating the family ngo's," as my brother-in-law has already promised my husband.)<br/><br/>in all my years, i never felt we were close to losing our constitutional protections. god help us all!<br/><br/>thank you, times! stay on the case! don't let us down! <S_SEP> the most haunting questions are: how deep does the infiltration into our government reach, and how do we root it out? mike pence's hands are not clean either. how can we replace an entire administration? special election? headshaking. <S_SEP> this is no way to govern a country. really sloppy.<br/>i hope the republicans are working on an exit strategy for trump.<br/>simply put, i don't think he is the right person for this job.<br/>he's had 60 days. it has not gone well.<br/>i fear the alternative is an american spring.<br/>civil disobedience. <S_SEP> remember"i' rather be right than president" ?<br/><br/>trump mag not be presidential enough (eapecially since the bar is cintrolled by hostile forces) but he' ususlly right - pours borders are dangerous and their violators can be rxpendive to support - isis, is what it is, unlike those weepy moments when opposing soldiers met and sang carols, each and every one if this lot are committed to killing us anywhere by any means possible - infrastructure - education- all of it even if his ways and means are debateable (no fan here) he's right.<br/><br/>and when he's "murky" we can count on you and yours to be wring...or way off the mark...when he said that "we've got some killers too"...he got slammed, but what we 've done in the way of messing up countries puts us in good company...the deposing if an elected goverment iran and its replacement by the shah, for only one example, lives on in misery and, if you will, infamy. <S_SEP> let's assume that a bi-partisan select committee isn't formed, as recommended in this editorial. let's further assume that the republicans' "show hearing" concludes with no action taken. if that is the case, and it certainly appears to be at this point, then we will have a republican congress that history will show actively assisted this corrupt administration in installing a fascist state.<br/><br/>in any other western democracy, millions of angry citizens would be in the streets, daily, weekly, at this point. <br/><br/>make no mistake -- we who hate to witness what has become of our country in these past few months are very much on our own. there will be no reversal of course in an orderly fashion, "working within the system", before a staggering degree of damage will be visited upon our nation. quite simply, our leaders have failed us. <br/><br/>the republican leadership knows that their voters, nearly half of our citizenry, are quite happy to live within a fascist state -- indeed their votes reflect their intent.<br/><br/>the rest of us will need to make some very difficult decisions in the next few months and years. and it is we who will be paying a staggering price -- and understand that there will be a price. our democracy will not be returned to us otherwise. <S_SEP> emperor donnie really stuck his foot in if this time. he lied once too many. <br/><br/>but the bigger issue is whether he or any of his people committed treason by giving aid and comfort to the enemy, russia, who tried to impermissibly influence our election in 2016. <br/><br/>if that is proven, people will need to go to jail. <br/><br/>if the republican ticket is tainted, that covers both donnie the dunce and pence, because the ticket is unitary. you vote once for both potus and vp. if that vote is was subject to a taint it affects both offices. <br/><br/>this could lead to a true constitutional crisis which was not contemplated by the founding fathers. how do you camcel the results of sn election? the constitution does not describe that. <S_SEP> impeachment is not enough- we need multiple perk walks-- jail. <S_SEP> , official acts i would argue that a corrupt potus gets zero deference. if he obtained office improperly, all of his "official acts" should be expunged in their entirety. <br/><br/>it is a principle of law that an illegal act cannot benefit the actor. a fortiori, a corrupt or treasonous act should not result in any benefit of any kind. here a corrupt act taints the entire ticket, because you get only one vote for both potus and vp. if there is a taint, the entire ticket is tainted. <S_SEP> here's the republican campaign to shift elections: 1-contest and gut key provisions of the voting rights act; 2-aggressively gerrymander districts to limit democrats winning seats; 3-pass onerous voter id rules targeting poor, elderly, african americans, and hispanic voters; 4-close tens of thousands of polling sites, reduce voter poll hours, days; 5-send voters to the wrong places to vote and run out the clock; 6-install fewer and broken/non-functioning machines in democratic-leaning districts; 7-underfund districts, run out of ballots; 8-practice outright voter intimidation and vote caging; 9-shunt voters to provisional ballots without proof they will be counted; 10-enable unlimited dark money to flood races thru citizens united, even foreigners can contribute; 11-purge 1.1+ million mostly african-americans from voter rolls in gop-controlled states through "crosscheck” (kansas sec. of state kevin kobach); 12-veto measures that would enroll millions when they apply for or renew their drivers license; 13-legalize methods to prevent votes from being tracked, fail to secure votes, and keep counting methods secret. and now: 14-use law suits to contest a recount or actual results in court. 15) use known “insecure voting software/machines” that can be hacked to flip, lose votes (see premier systems software). u.s. computer scientists have demonstrated in the insecurities russians exploited <S_SEP> this is not about losing. this is about having, at a minimum, a probably crook in the white house. if there's no there there, fine, but we deserve to know.<br/><br/>as to his being the president, unfortunately for us, he is. while i don't root for him to fail, i am horrified at what he's done so far. i have seen nothing to support him for yet. he's the sorest, most disgusting "winner" we've ever had to deal with. he doesn't even try to reach out to all american's, in fact he called those who voted against him his "enemies". i am horrified, why aren't you? <S_SEP> " i see the sinister part, but not the logical part"<br/>to see the logic would mean that you would have to understand the working of a mind that would be frightening to habit. 45 is a multitude of diagnosis and all are working to feed his fragile and immature ego's need for attention and adulation. there is no "there there" in any normal sense of the word. it is so hard to understand because you would need to be clinically trained to untie the core distorted view of the world and the pretzels his mind ties into to create the rational and drive the behavior that serves those needs. it is a representation of an unfamiliar diseased psychological process that we would never have imagined would occupy the most powerful position and responsibility in the world. his minions and the repubs can only enable him for so long before he breaks and does something that even they will not be able to defend or rationalize away. most people can't imagine that his actions as holder of such an important office already qualify, but it is amazing what people will do to maintain power and the behavior that they will tolerate as long as it serves to forward their cause and keep their position. <S_SEP> and then you'll have pence, who is far more doctrinaire and conservative than trump is -- trump is actually a moderate and barely a republican at all.<br/><br/>is that honestly what will make you happy? i've talked to and read posts from a number of angry democrats who seem to believe that if trump is disposed of -- no matter how, impeachment, resignation, etc. -- hillary clinton will get the throne by default. that is not even remotely how this all works. <S_SEP> basically, i see it as detente. what would you prefer? however, if the ny times prefers war, we'll send you all over there first.
there is no reason that trump cannot release his full tax returns. not only is the "under audit" the most pathetic of excuses, but now with 2016 returns being readied, he is not under audit for this year's taxes. so let's see them, big boy. show us what you've got. we should all be demanding this. <S_SEP> i have yet to read or see how the russians influenced the election. they did not hack into individual voting machines or stand outside the polling places and threaten voters. the fbi and cia investigated these claims end they both concluded that the russians did not influence the election. the media keeps pushing this narrative. trump won because of the bad governing during the past 8 years. obama ignored laws he did not like, changed the aca law without congress, a definite illegal move, the fast and furious gun running scheme where obama hid evidence under the guise of executive privilege, obama bowing to a saudi prince, the bengahzi lies about a video, and the list is exhaustive. why is the media not focusing on all of those unconstitutional acts by obama? <S_SEP> what nonsense!! tax returns do not even show assets. these silly people never bothered to even think about it as stock holding appear nowhere!!! go to the federal elections commission data where trump filed is financial statement. i feel sorry for you if you evaluate companies based upon their tax returns. <S_SEP> what frightens me most is a republican congress that is excusing or looking the other way on all of trump's deviant behavior. <br/><br/>if true, collusion with russia would be a serious attack on our country. is a tax cut for the wealthy really worth what they seem willing to pay? there must be some honorable republicans left. why aren't they speaking up? <S_SEP> the republicans and the president should be very upset and concerned about russians meddling in the election. the fact that the president does not show any concern is a huge red flag. republicans need to stand up for the american people and support the investigation of this extremely serious matter. leaks are troubling, but not as troubling as a foreign country getting involved in our election. <S_SEP> the most likely explanation at this point is that trump is leading a long-term, multi-faceted campaign to benefit our chief global adversary that continues today--and is intensifying. the most probably reason trump is leading this effort is financial. he has already received a 60 million dollar wet kiss from putin buddy "fertilizer king" dmitry rybolovle. dimitry continues to support trump, meeting with him (or his team) from time to time at airports around the country where his plane "just happens" to be in the same place as the trump plane--including more "coincidences" both after the election and after the inauguration. (and this is only one of the many trump-team russian coordination mechanisms found so far).<br/>republicans, of course, put party above country, lies above reality, and money above the health and lives of their constituents, and will not recognize treason in a republican no matter what. <S_SEP> it is obvious to anyone paying attention (and to anyone who listened to rep. adam schiff lay out the timetable and names of "coincidences") that the trump campaign colluded with russia in order to steal the campaign from hillary clinton - (and i suspect protect trump personal (dossier?) and business interests in russia).<br/><br/>this is what i don't get, though: when someone steals something from another and is caught, isn't the stolen item returned to the rightful owner, or restitution of some kind made to the owner? when it is proven that the trump campaign, along with russia, stole this election, why should the gop be rewarded by removing trump and putting pence into the oval office? shouldn't the rightful winner, who indeed was voted for by 3 million more americans, and who knows how many but for the theft (and comey's interference) have her win returned to her rather than handed to someone in the thieving camp?<br/><br/>why is it so impossible for this country to right this wrong?? <S_SEP> by not appointing a special prosecutor, the republican controlled justice department and republican controlled congress are putting their thumbs in the eyes of most americans. they are signalling a coverup. why would republicans do that?<br/><br/>because they have an agenda and trump has given them the means to carry out that agenda. republicans don't care how ethically dirty they get in the process; they are operating on their immoral belief, the ends justify the means. <S_SEP> , russia and election i turned off the hearing after just a few minutes.<br/>the republicans on the committee show no interest in asking tough questions. instead, i heard questions that appear to attempt to give trump cover.<br/>devin nunes, the republican charged with chairing the committee, absurdly asked , going state by state in states where the vote was close, whether comey found evidence of russian hacking into the individual state voting machines, and if so whether those votes favored trump.<br/>anyone who has stayed abreast of this knows that no one has even suggested that that occurred. the obvious answer was 'no', but comey was less than candid in merely responding with a 'no' answer.<br/>he should have told nunes that everyone knows that that is not even being investigated as everyone agrees it is a non-issue.<br/>republicans are positively shameless in attempting to give trump any cover whatsoever, given the gravity of the real issues that they should be asking about.<br/>republicans will whitewash this if allowed to do so.<br/>bring on a special prosecutor.<br/>raise my taxes if more revenue is needed to do so. <S_SEP> , hrc, election rigging trump ran for president - a great surprise to many.<br/>he did so because he knew he could/would win.<br/>his entire outrageous and offensive campaign, his demeaning attitude toward many groups of persons, and his blatant over-confidence/swagger were possible because he knew he could/would win. <br/><br/>the election is"rigged" he said.<br/>yes - most likely for him and not for hrc. he implied it to be "rigged" for her more than once.<br/>"rigged" he said. he and other overt and covert operatives may know this to be the true case for him. <br/><br/>the main task is to find out who they are and/or who they represented.<br/>who did it? russia or gop or trump or two of them as a combination or all of them together as one determined "400 lb. unit - sitting on a bed" of their own making. <br/><br/>why was trump so determined to ignore, drop, slide over the entire issue of the hacking of pre-election elements - the dnc for one.<br/><br/>to be considered is the hacking of the actual election in the compilation of the voting results received from all of the states.<br/>meeting predetermined results is possible in the computer software system designed to compile the final voting results in the aggregate.<br/>77,000 votes spread over 3 states - is computer manipulation child's play. <br/><br/>ask:<br/>can this act be labeled as high crimes or misdemeanors or even treason?<br/>win by sweeping the 2018 elections and then impeach trump in the house.<br/>it couldn't happen to a more deserving guy ....... or plant. <S_SEP> i realize the cows may have left the barn, but here's an idea to keep this from happening again: the states, or the two political parties in the states (especially iowa and new hampshire...) should require a presidential candidate to release the last five(?) years of tax returns to place his/her name on the primary/caucus ballot. <S_SEP> expect nothing from the gop, unless its toadies fear their careers going down the drain. <br/><br/>maybe.
, ukraine's freedom at last, a grown up takes the stage -- democratic congressman adam schiff -- and what he lays out at the house hearing, in a crystal clear, lawyerly way, is damning: the likelihood that back in july, just before the republican convention, the trump campaign cut a deal with the russians as follows: the russians would release stolen hillary emails through a cut out (wiki leaks) in order to damage her chances of election and trump, in return, would advocate the following policies: a) no offensive weapons for ukraine; and b) condemnation of our european nato allies for not paying their fair share of defense costs. in other words, policies which undercut ukraine's chances of fighting its way free of russia, and undercut nato. these are putin's top two foreign policy objectives. i urge you to watch schiff's presentation at the house hearings on russian interference with the election. it's short:<br/><a href="https://thinkprogress.org/this-congressmans-short-speech-crisply-lays-out-the-evidence-of-collusion-between-trump-and-russia-d166801a11fa#.ptlaneyq8" title="https://thinkprogress.org/this-congressmans-short-speech-crisply-lays-out-the-evidence-of-collusion-between-trump-and-russia-d166801a11fa#.ptlaneyq8" target="_blank">https://thinkprogress.org/this-congressmans-short-speech-crisply-lays-ou...</a><br/> the more you think about it, the more surreal -- and chilling -- it becomes. this investigation could demonstrate (or at least compellingly suggest -- which in politics is the same thing) that a sitting president not only aided and abetted but actively encouraged a foreign power in an attack on the united states. that, my fellow americans, is by definition treason. <S_SEP> in this time of unrivaled partisan politics, it could not be more apparent that we need an impartial, independent investigation of russian meddling in our democracy. the republicans have tied themselves too closely to the trump administration to be trusted to shine light on russia's new cyber threats to democracy here and abroad. the time is now for a broad non-partisan investigation of this threat, because an emboldened russia, already with some success using hacking and fake news, may well do much more damage in our next election. <S_SEP> "comey's haunting news on trump's team ties to russia" ? common nyeb, this is a title plucked from the national enquirer, not worthy of the paper of record! i watched the hearing. it was boring. comey only said that anything was possible and that he couldn't give any details, info, scoup, etc until the investigation is over. clinton, bill and hill, as well as the clinton team, had much more ties with the russians than trump's team. they sold 20% of us uranium to russian, bill received about 120 millions for this foundation from various russian-connections in return, including a 500,000 birthday gift, etc. (all public record, according to the nyt). <S_SEP> republicans are complicit in this treason. as such it seems a perfect coup, with the gop gladly sweeping all the dots under the rug. <br/><br/>at the very least there should be a select committee established with even numbers of republicans and democrats, dedicated to the russian involvement of the campaign. yet mitch mcconnell would rather put his party before the country--again. he really really needs to get the boot, for us to get back on track as a symbol of freedom and liberty for all. <br/><br/>until then we are mired in the mcconnell/ryan/trump republican swamp. <S_SEP> let's be honest. during the campaign, republicans stated that they intended to impeach clinton if she were elected. they kept referring to an individual under fbi investigation as being unfit to hold office. if clinton had won and every one of these damning details were reversed to her side of the aisle, republicans wouldn't be satisfied with just impeachment. we would probably be facing a new election that would "legitimately" express the will of the american "people" (e.g. their base). too bad democrats can't find a shred of that fervor. too bad for our democracy. <S_SEP> agree wholeheartedly that an independent investigation needs to be opened immediately, particularly since comey has been a prop in gop theater to de-legitimize clinton's candidacy.<br/><br/>but who gets to decide "independence" in this hyper-partisan, gop majority-led congress? i'm envisioning a fight over the appointment of investigators which will drag out this mess for longer than necessary. now would be the time for the gop to put their country over party to get to the bottom of this russian entangled morass. sadly, i'm not sure they've got the guts. <S_SEP> comey is the only one i trust to determine if there was any criminal wrongdoing. he refused to sign off on unconstitutional surveillance guidelines despite pressure from bush's white house counsel while acting ag when ag ashcroft was in hospital; was praised by democrats and condemned by republicans for declining to prosecute hillary over her home e-mail server, then just as quickly condemned by democrats and praised by republicans when he said she was reckless for bypassing the state department's e-mail system; condemned by democrats when he reopened the investigation when the fbi found new e-mails between hillary and huma on a laptop huma shared with weiner in the course of the investigation of weiner for sexting a 15-year-old girl; made republicans angry when it was disclosed he had briefed obama on the "dirty dossier" authored by the former mi-6 agent--the allegations of which the fbi has been unable to substantiate and several of which have been proved false; more recently made republicans mad by asking the ag to say obama could not, by himself, order surveillance on trump; and, probably just made both sides upset in refusing to say anymore than there is an investigation and that the fbi will decide whether there is sufficient proof of a criminal conspiracy to prosecute--meaning no special prosecutor and no congressional hearings circuses. he isn't perfect, but he is as close as you are going to get in d.c. <S_SEP> what haunting news? comey and the nsa both said in congressional public testimony that there was no evidence that trump had colluded with the russians to fix the election. trump really had no need for the russian's assistance.<br/>vacant accusations by a partisan opponent do not constitute circumstantial evidence. <S_SEP> , russia's military action in crimea what to think about the sanctions that the obama administration enacted against russia after they annexed crimea, meddled in ukraine when it wanted to join the eu, and shot down a civilian airplane killing hundreds over ukraine? they would have remained in place under a clinton administration, while trump will let putin get away with his expansionism and probably lift the sanctions. trump also falsely accused obama of wiretapping him, which can only be for two reasons: 1. distraction (from the sessions problem), 2) projection, of his own behavior onto others (he knew the russians were wiretapping obama and/or his officials, maybe even asked for it, like he did when he asked them to hack hillary's emails). <S_SEP> trump and manafort lied about not having anything to do with changing the gop platform in favor of russia vs. ukraine. it's on video. now they're finally admitting they did indeed change the gop platform in favor of russia. rachel maddow has done an amazing job connecting these dots. anyone who hasn't watched, should. the next question she's asking -- is the decimation of the state dept. under tillerson and trump a payback to russia for their help getting trump elected. tillerson came out of nowhere and is pals with putin. putin hates our state dept. and would love to see it weakened. and it seems he has his wish. the gop needs to wake up and stop enabling the destruction of our country and world standing. it's abundantly clear that something is going on -- yes, it seems like a bad spy novel, but the dots keep connecting. and as kristof rightly states, there are many of them. <br/><br/>it's too bad the gop can't seem to step up and protect our democracy. as a start, we need independent investigations -- and they need to be accelerated. the press is moving much faster than the current investigators, so it seems the latter are dragging their feet (at best). <S_SEP> , ukraine, rnc platform committee, pro-russia remarks let's discuss all their significant reversals and denials, such as this:<br/>on march 4th, 2017, mr. j.d. gordon, trump's national security policy rep at the republican convention, told cnn he had made a gop platform language change based on what “donald trump himself wanted + advocated for” at a march 2016 meeting at trump hotel in d.c.<br/><br/>on march 7th, gordon changed his story on his involvement in changing the ukraine amendment to pro-russian language: “i didn’t change the platform nor did i say i did.”<br/>(he did say he did)<br/>gordon made this abrupt statement change within 3 days. why?<br/><br/>you'll recall it was ties to a pro-russia political party in ukraine that resulted in paul manafort's resignation as trump’s campaign chair aug. 19th.<br/><br/>christopher steele, former mi6 spy, will be testifying before the senate intel committee’s investigation into trump's links to russia.<br/>in june, he delivered a spy memo to the fbi stating that trump’s team agreed to a russian request to "dilute attention on moscow’s intervention in ukraine."<br/><br/>4 days later trump publicly stated he'd recognize russia's annexation of crimea.<br/>republicans on the rnc platform committee were already on record complaining trump removed a pledge for military assistance to ukraine against separatist rebels in the east of the country. they can be googled by name.<br/>that same day, trump called on russia to hack hillary clinton’s emails.<br/>trump staffers were later outed for their russia contacts, trump still in denial. <S_SEP> i tend to agree with kristof''s opinion on where this smoke might lead. trump was desperate for capital not too long ago and russian money offered a lifeline. there is likely dirt here that could be crippling and his hands-off approach to russia could be his way of trying to keep the lid on some shady financial dealings. if their is any collusion around the leaks, my guess is it was opportunistic. he also has been a magnet for russophile types, either for gain (manafort, page, ross) or ideological reasons (bannon, flynn). also wouldn't surprise me if he was even aware of all machinations going on in the background with this crew. either way, it's not a good spot to be in.
i have little doubt trump has been tied up with dirty russian money for years. if you missed rachael maddow's show last evening, it's a must watch (link below). a singular crook featured in her show is ukrainian born, russian-connected, trump-connected, dymtro firtash. the us has been trying to extradite him since 2014. today the austrian court ruled in favour of the us. this guy has lots of dirt on little donnie: the noose is tightening, i'd say. now what will sessions do to save his good buddy, trump?<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jud52etde5g" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jud52etde5g" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jud52etde5g</a><br/><a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/21/austrian-court-approves-extradition-ukrainian-tycoon-dmytro/" title="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/21/austrian-court-approves-extradition-ukrainian-tycoon-dmytro/" target="_blank">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/02/21/austrian-court-approves-extra...</a> <S_SEP> 11. he publicly encouraged russian hacking <S_SEP> trump is an ignorant chief deplorable. say it and get it over with. you say "trump isn't intellectual". what a profound statement. well. neither is half of america intellectual. now with ms. devos in charge of education, the other half will join el presidente. <S_SEP> , money laundering, real estate, trump i can't help but put together the fact that trump is in real estate and the stories in these pages about high end real estate purchases by parties so complicated it took months to find out who actually bought it. the buyer inevitably turned out to be a foreigner floating in so much cash they bought it to stash it in a manner that raises questions of tax evasion, money laundering with ties to drugs and illegal weapons.<br/><br/>do i think trump is implicated? wouldn't i deserve to be taken if i didn't?<br/><br/>that's the normal channel of business in his field of trade. can it be that all the people of wealth and power are so in bed with each other that not one of them is willing to point out trump's blatant flaunting the requirements of office let alone do anything about it? <S_SEP> , russia and election from august 15, 2016 atlantic monthly article:<br/>"in a major piece published sunday evening, the new york times delves into the work of trump campaign chairman paul manafort in ukraine. for years, manafort worked for viktor yanukovych, a kremlin protege who was deposed as president amid widespread demonstrations in 2014."<br/> you've trolled these waters before, and came up with?? right, nothing. so today, you have nothing new to say, but use your vaporware as one peg in a non-existent conspiracy that everyone has already conceded, did nothing to "hack the election." some russians hacked the dnc; a miniscule story last october that you are blowing into an atom-bomb because trump won. btw, yanukovych was "deposed" after being elected. how many other elected officials in europe have been similarly deposed in the last 5 years? any wonder russia sees his ouster as a nato-led "coup"? do you ever wonder if you are a pawn of neo-cons who want war with russia? <S_SEP> the good news for trump is, he can say, "it was manafort and flynn, not me. i had the wisdom to fire them. see? not my fault" <S_SEP> , ties to putin, russian loans all anyone has to do is put ' trump's russian loans ' on the top search bar and a myriad of articles will come up showing all the ties and business dealings. the fact that trump couldn't raise money from u.s. banks. the gangsters tied to putin. manafort's wheeling and dealing. i mean what was manafort doing as campaign mgr in the first place. he's a russian lobbiest. there's sessions &amp; flynn. trump's son said early on we have numerous russian dealings. rex t has a billion dollar investment ( that could reap 1/2 a trillion ) in russia on hold do to sanctions. there's all the email's coming out of russia, only against the dems. there's comey's letter 10 days out that helped trump get elected, (how can he investigate when he is involved?). there's the russian ambassador at the rep convention. the trump plane and ambassador's plane at the same airports at least 5 times during the campaign. it goes on and on.<br/> our dear leader is owned to the tune of around a billion dollars to the russians. and also the very embarrassing sexual perversion rumors. that's why he's always sticking up for them. it's so obvious it's ridiculous. of course there needs to be a special prosecutor and committee. <br/><br/> orange, nj <S_SEP> thanks nick, for laying out all "dots." you're right about paul manafort who just been revealed to also have lied about having "zero" contacts with russian operatives. in fact, manafort colluded with a russian intelligence agent to weaken an anti-russian, pro-ukrainian plank in the republican party platform. hers we have the actual fire of collusion beneath the smoke of denial and coverup. <S_SEP> when propagandists on the editorial board start mewling about a shared responsibility to safeguard american democracy, their partisan political skullduggery is the real issue that needs safeguarding. the sole interest of this newspaper is to thwart the will of the people and bring down a duly elected president by any means necessary. when democracy works for their veiled agenda by means of say, a special prosecutor to wield an ax and damage the president, they raise the flag and hand out apple pie. when it doesn't and the wrong guy wins, when they look like partisan fools, its time to riot in the streets. they care as much for democracy as you do about what their real agenda is. <S_SEP> another dot. wilbur ross, trump's commerce secretary, owns a cyprus bank with a russian billionaire and putin friend and beneficiary. he bought a palm beach mansion from trump and paid trump $100 million and trump paid $40 million 2 years earlier. a $60 million profit in 2 years! really? see rachel maddow show. <a href="http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/rachel-maddow-show/2017-02-27" title="http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/rachel-maddow-show/2017-02-27" target="_blank">http://www.msnbc.com/transcripts/rachel-maddow-show/2017-02-27</a>. <S_SEP> if the decision to appoint a special prosecutor rests in the hands of the attorney general's office, does anyone really see this happening? the fact that the trump campaign is likely to have overstepped its bounds makes it even less so. <S_SEP> the selection of rex tillerson is also odd and perhaps a choice suggested by the russians or their supporters?
, a select committee to investigate russia and trump i thank the times editorial board for its frank and forthright recommendation that a select committee be established, with subpoena power, to look into the many contacts between the trump campaign and russian operatives. we must find out the degree to which the trump campaign colluded with russia, if at all, to influence the 2016 election results. if established (and it needs to be established) it must be independent of the justice dept. the editorial board correctly identified numerous pitfalls of a political nature that could weaken or destroy such an investigation. we, the people, cannot allow that to happen. <S_SEP> given the hyper partisan moment our country is going through, we should have an independent investigation of the russian effort to influence the election. the scope of the investigation should be broad enough to include the trump administration's ties to russia. the person selected to head the investigation should be someone who has the trust of both parties and the respect of the public. congressional investigations are important, but are unlikely to produce a final word on this topic, and a final word is what the country needs. <S_SEP> we must all telephone our congressional representatives this week to demand the appointment of an independent counsel and an independent, bipartisan commission to continue the investigation of russiagate. the gop will not do the right thing out of ethical concern. they will only do it in the face of overwhelming public demand, so let's make that demand and make it loudly. <S_SEP> , trump cronies who would serve on a bi-partisan committee that could be trusted to carry out in a timely manner an investigation and a naming of a special prosecutor?<br/>look at what just happened when comey and rogers testified yesterday. all the republicans did was try to change the subject by wanting the leakers brought to justice. really? how about pursuing the allegations re russian interference in the eection first and trump's cronies ties to the russians first? it ain't goin' to happen. <S_SEP> one very important reason to have an independent commission investigating the russian connection are the preventive recommendations that could be forthcoming. any such commission should invite cybersecurity experts to testify. they wouldn't provide actual details that would tip off our adversaries, but they would point us in the right direction. any such prophylaxis would help assure us that those in charge are interested in preventing a repeat. <S_SEP> , russian interference in the elections i've had no doubt about russian interference in the elections. i have no doubt the sitting president is in bed with them. every cabinet "loyalist"<br/>(good for putin) is out to destroy (dismantle) the dept. in which they're in charge. many have russian ties. we don't know how far this goes - can we actually get an independent commission to cover all this kleptocracy's deals with other dictatorships? tillerson is keeping all of it quiet. the state dept. title is ludicrous when there isn't a state dept.<br/><br/>on 2/27, david frum and the ex-editor of time mag. implored us to demand an investigation before it was too late. people on the news are looking a bit frightened today. time to call congress and demand constantly demand an independent commission because we are being obviously taken over by russia. <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair without either a special prosecutor or non-partisan select committee i fear the truth will never be uncovered. having said that, not enough attention is being paid to mi6 agent christopher steele's report. his report details many meetings with top trump advisers and russian operatives in european cities in the summer of 2016. his report clearly states that there was direct collusion with trump's knowledge. steele was mi6's top russian spy for decades. he had great contacts and was so upset that the fbi was not pursuing leads that he actually worked for a period of time for free. the ny times corroborates the european meetings as was passed on by dutch and british intelligence agencies. the collusion was real. i believe christopher steele got it right. <S_SEP> do we realy think the justice dept and the fbi will investigate this fairly? the same fbi that sent a letter. two weeks before the election to republicans in congress saying hillar may still get busted ? now we find out trumps russian ties were being investigated for months before the election in secret? that would have been nice to know before going into the voting booth. <S_SEP> it is hard to believe that the infamous tax returns cannot be subpoenaed, though i worry if the fbi director subpoenas them, in light of his behavior before the election, the truth will not be revealed except through a leak. of all the insanity that has come out of the current administration, this one should be kept in the forefront until resolved. i fear that more tweets and other apparently impulsive behavior coming from #45 will cloud the issue. there is too much smoke here for there not to be a fire. <S_SEP> plus more than a dozen meetings outlined by the dossier have now been confirmed with respect to the parties, the locations and the times and dates.<br/><br/>trump will try to coopt the intelligence agencies before this whole story hits the fan, i predict. <S_SEP> the times editorial board makes a strong argument for a special prosecutor to take charge of the investigation of russia's involvement in hacking and otherwise meddling with the 2016 national election. fine. but where in the name of god, has anyone on the board found evidence that mr. comey is a capable, reliable, and committed individual who can assure the american people that the f.b.i. will do its very best to seek out information and make sure that justice is done? was it not mr. comey who, according to research done by nate silver, singlehandedly turned the 2016 election on its head with his public statements regarding hillary clinton not just once, but twice; one of those announcements within one week of the election itself? from his first televised statement on begazi on, it has seemed clear that mr. comey has done his own bit of "election engineering". this has been commented on, here and there in the media. why, however, was mr. comey not relieved of his position; why has he himself not been prosecuted; and finally, why are we now being assured of mr. comedy's commitment to follow wherever the truth leads us? if there can be even the appearance of impropriety on his part relating to the election, how can we trust that a cover -up is not in progress? <S_SEP> , money as the wise patriot advised woodward and bernstein 4 decades ago..."follow the money." it will bring us all to the true nature of the trump-russia (and tillerson/ross/kushner et al) relationship and just why they vociferously lie and obfuscate about the investigations. donald trump has never been motivated by anything other than self interest and pure greed. the truth that the investigations will reveal will bring down all the trump and co. financing and their self constructs. we need comey, the courts and all of the congress to put country first and do their jobs to preserve the democracy.
more power to comey for yesterday's revelation that the fbi has been investigating possible ties between the russians and the trump campaign since last july . but the question has to be asked: why weren't we told this before the election? what made it more important for comey to reveal what turned out to be disinformation on hilary clinton one week before america went to the polls, while sitting on this far more inflammatory story about trump? i wish someone had managed to sneak in a follow up question about that yesterday. <S_SEP> and if comey finds collusion, then what? will he indict his boss sessions? will the republicans start impeachment proceedings? will we have a new election?<br/>the sound and fury that signifies-nothing. <S_SEP> , abraham lincoln perhaps comey can redeem himself after sabotaging the clinton campaign. i hope he holds the course and doesn't break in the face of a full bore pro-trump onslaught. <S_SEP> me, too. it was obvious the gop felt they had to make someone other than trump look bad. so they stepped in and acted guilty as sin. don't look at the leak, find the leaker, unless the leak is russian. then it's spectacular, believe me.<br/><br/>did i hear gowdy threaten to withhold re-authorization of 702 if he doesn't hear what he wants? must finally be working. <S_SEP> there was a genuinely disturbing event yesterday too.<br/><br/>gowdy made it absolutely clear that the leaker committed a felony -- even if the material leaked was not classified -- and that he will block the fbi if comey attempts to prosecute anyone using illegally-obtained evidence. he went out of his way to note that whoever published that illegally-obtained material also committed a felony, presumably obligating the fbi to prosecute that source, as well as to refuse to use the evidence itself. <br/><br/>one should expect gowdy's inquisition to seek out scapegoats and to protect wrongdoers every bit as vigorously as he did in hillary clinton's case. <S_SEP> as a boy i was caught up in the excitement of the watergate hearings; such a drama it was. today's telecast was as boring as it was depressing. with the exception of congressman schiff, the participants seemed puny partisans, men and women devoid of historical perspective and moral integrity. it's as if trumpism has replaced the conservative values once espoused by the republican party. <S_SEP> you expect fbi director james comey and senate republicans to end friendly deference and begin investigating in earnest? god help america find some leakers. <S_SEP> comey must be asked why, weeks before the election, he offered scant "rumors" that his department had found more "damaging" emails about hillary clinton. those never released emails immediately turned the significant majority of voters from clinton, to a equal level. without question, he gave the election to trump. he is, and always will be, a bought and paid for gop shill... <S_SEP> i'm old enough to have lived through watergate. it was wildly exciting to see the news each day. it was like a spy novel in real time. but it ended up being horribly corrosive to the nation and its willingness to trust the government. i see the same thing shaping up now and dread the final result. and, based on what we've seen so far, the blame lies with trump and his senior advisers. <S_SEP> all that united sates stood for or strive to stand for is disappearing at an alarming rate with trump and his cronies who defend him even when those who can read english know exactly what the meaning of their statement is.<br/>its just disgusting to see mr spicer come up with any non sense and quote a truly fake news like that of fox. the commentators on cable network are no better either.<br/>republicans are fixated on the leakers rather than the truth. leakers is a diversionary tactic used to stay away from the real issue.<br/>in fact thank god for the leakers oitherewise we would never know how this country is being sold. <S_SEP> , ukraine affair i want to be fair to comey despite the fact that his last minute decision to announce to the world that hillary's assistant's husband might have sensitive info on the private computer he shared with his wife negatively affected hillary's chances of winning the election. president obama seems to have had confidence in comey. remember, president obama wanted to lay what our security services knew before the public prior to the election but mitch mcconnell said that it would influence the election and refused to agree to it. comey had to abide by that decision to hold off until after the election. <S_SEP> to "follow the facts wherever they lead" could sound the death knell for this 60 day old administration. this result would be a just coda to a presidency that should never have been foisted upon the american people. that this president won the general election is no longer as important as to how he achieved his success. it is absolutely certain that the white house will do everything it can to obstruct, obfuscate and hinder any probe into possible chicanery and criminal conduct in the late campaign for the oval office. <br/><br/>it is to the fbi director's credit that he will bring the full resources of his bureau to bear in moving forward to uncover the truth of these allegations. the cloud of perjury hovering over the administration's attorney general is a danger sign that warns of all sorts of unpleasant discoveries that may be unearthed as this inquiry proceeds. hopefully, this time, republicans will put party affiliation aside and work with democrats to defend the integrity of america's electoral process, no matter where this investigation will lead.
it's all about the money.<br/><br/>at the bottom of all this unease about the trump-putin connection is the simple suspicion that trump, his family and his "organization" have a large financial exposure in russia. <br/><br/>russia is a big-oil kleptocracy, with a large element of organized crime stretching around the globe. it is also no secret that new york real estate is a favorite money-laundering spot for the russian oil moguls.<br/><br/>add to this the well known fact that putin is personally involved in all big international business deals involving russia and you have a recipe for disaster.<br/><br/>in short, to use the old yankee business expression, there is less than an "arm's length" relationship between trump and russia.<br/><br/>of course, the only way we can truly get to the bottom of all this is to see trump's tax returns and financial statements. nothing will get resolved until we get this critical information. until then, we are just shooting in the dark. <S_SEP> just keeping tally after reading many of these comments,for the possible connections between trump and russia: investors in trump businesses and properties, white nationalism, oil, admiration of putin as a strongman. <S_SEP> @schrodinger<br/><br/>there is more than enough evidence that putin began to recruit trump before the 2008 election. i propose that the "birther lie" was a russian plant. trumps business ties to russia predated the 2008 election. it is ridiculous to think that lucrative financial deals with putin's minions did not also include requests for other favors. even the richest man in the world, supposedly putin, does not give money away without expecting some kind of return. what putin values most is power. increasing russian power at the expense of american power, how much is that worth in dollars? <S_SEP> there must be things in the trump tax returns that we should know about, but i doubt trump has financial ties to russia that are influencing his behavior. he now has, after all, access to much greater sums of money from other authoritarian regimes who want to influence us behavior. why wouldn't he double-cross his russian partners? he's been more than willing to do so in the past.<br/>i think the real reason is ideological, combined with a psychological connection to a strong leader that trump takes as a model. he has bannon whispering in his ear, constantly, and bannon has a coherent world-view that puts russia at the front line of resistance to islamic extremism.<br/>and, yes, that's terrifying. i'd take a financial connection over this any time. though i would like to see those tax returns. <S_SEP> maybe trump is splitting hairs, maybe he doesnt have any loans from russia, but what he does appear to have is a lot of "customers" buying his (or his partner's) projects who are russian. there has been discussion of these properties providing a money laundering outlet for dubiously obtained russian funds. tit for tat. the power and political motives are strictly the icing on the mogul's ego, but the most dangerous to the world. <S_SEP> here's the bottom line: russia is today in a position to dictate who is in our white house, simply by russia's coming out and saying "yeah we bought the trump administration," whether it is true or not. due to donald trump, our national autonomy is exposed and at risk like never before. <S_SEP> money laundering for the russian mafia through real estate shell companies is trump's game. i did get a big laugh out of the idea that trump is motivated by wanting to end a humanitarian crisis in syria though - he's displayed even less compassion than intellectual curiosity in his brief time as a politician. <S_SEP> trump’s "russia motives" are primarily financial. russia's economic growth during putin's first two terms a decade ago was impressive and russia, as an energy superpower dazzled him. trump said on one occasion: “moscow right now in the world is a very, very important place. we wanted moscow all the way.” during a visit in 2013, he boasted: “the russian market is attracted to me. i have a great relationship with many russians, and almost all of the oligarchs were in the room”.<br/>his past dealings with russia went as far back as the time of the soviet union. in 1987, he wanted to build branded hotels and condos in moscow. “it’s a totally interesting place,” he said. “i think the soviet union is really making an effort to cooperate in the sense of dealing openly with other nations and in opening up the country.”<br/>his desire to build a trump tower near red square continued throughout the 1990s and in 2013 he travelled to moscow, hoping to meet putin while staging the debut of his miss universe beauty pageant. according to washing post, putin cancelled the meeting at the last minute, but sent a gift and personal note. trump did collect a a share of the $14m paid by investors including aras agalarov, a azerbaijani-russian billionaire property developer and close putin associate, for bringing miss universe to agalarov’s city hall. <S_SEP> rachel maddow has done an excellent detailing the, shall we say "coincidences" of the trump team's russian intersections. this is especially true with regard to large amounts of money inexplicably moving in the direction of the trump organization. every day previously implausible scenarios of corruption and collusion become more firmly rooted in reality. <S_SEP> i think the "why" is very important and david does seem to have discussed all of the likely reasons. it maybe likely a combination of issues. i cannot help but view trump as a man with such a fragile ego that he is easily manipulated. i do not think he has the intellect to reason himself to his own sound conclusions. his narcissistic feeders such as bannon know how to manipulate him, to his very core, including the approval of a strong, man's man leader such as putin. i also think there are likely russian originated loans on the books for far flung trump properties. those loans maybe hard to find because there could be a "front" financial institution that acted as the middle man. that is why he says with such confidence he does not owe the russians any money. <S_SEP> "trump has expressed a bewilderingly benign view of russia..." people insist on this view as proof of the existence of kompromat on trump because they can't find a reason to explain it according to their own instruments, but if you snoop around the alt-right information sphere a little you will find it's not that bewildering to them: "we are in a war of civilization with islam," etc., "we need allies," etc., and the biggest and most important potential ally is, of course, "russia." more precisely a version of it. from this perspective, from planet bannon, trump's view makes all the sense in the world. i'm amazed that the media don't focus on this. <S_SEP> another dot is also the connection of the trump team through cohen (his lawyer) to the unexplained death of a russian in one of trump's buildings in florida. the following article came out march 1, he "died" on march 2. so many of the business deals seem to involve large amounts of cash, which is what russian oligarchs need to move into legitimate assets, preferably in the u.s. putin saw trump had exactly that talent, long ago.
"the fairest assumption is that he has russian business ties he wants to keep hidden."<br/><br/>what are the odds that a thin skinned huckster who defrauded thousands of his fellow citizens and bankrupted small businesses as part if his business strategy, is motivated by money?<br/><br/>his bromance with putin's authoritarian rule may be just that, a need to compensate for certain personal failures? now, if putin has any "kompromat" on our 45th president, it will not be the fbi or cia who discovers it. russia's fsb will release in due time. <br/><br/>the issue here is whether any or all of the above led trump and/or his aides (some now members of his administration) to undermine our elections, foreign policy and national security. <br/><br/>i believe the answer is yes. and if you care about keeping america great, you should at least want to know and let the evidence keep coming out. <S_SEP> trump's son has talked about substantial financial connections with russians, and it appears likely that trump is beholden to them in some ways.<br/><br/>however, if you examine his espousal of conspiracy theories and other (actually) fake news originated by fox, infowars, and breitbart, and his seemingly excessive support of certain organizations and individuals, there is one thing in common to all of them: they have flattered him.<br/><br/>his vanity above all else informs all of his actions. he thinks vlad called him brilliant. ths was actually a slight mistranslation. vlad was calling him a shiny object. <S_SEP> what trump lacks is an assumption that the u.s. and russia can’t come to acceptable terms on cooperation simply because we don’t like putin. i’m sure trump has loathed some of the co-investors in his projects (as some undoubtedly loathed him), yet somehow managed to co-exist long enough to get buildings built. there’s a lesson there for those who write about how the world should be without any responsibility for building anything.<br/><br/>david offers the premise that “murky” ties exist between trump and his people on one side and putin and his goons on the other; yet offers no evidence that his premise is valid. what has surfaced are communications between trump’s people, not just with russia but with dozens of foreign representatives, claimed to be no more than the nebulous expressions of “better relations” to come. the agencies whose civil servants, outrageously lionized in the times as “whistle-blowers” but in fact ideologues exercising a stolen power to destroy, have insinuated dastardly deeds while admitting that no evidence exists of illegal or even censurable actions. they rely on transcripts that only they have reviewed but haven’t released.<br/><br/>the agencies already weighed in: there’s nothing there. mccain’s committee will conclude the same thing, and the msm, abetted by those same civil servant fellow-travelers, will move on to other spurious challenges to an administration they find ideologically unacceptable. don’t expect to have an appreciable impact on our governance. <S_SEP> the political conspiracy seems like the most plausible. even obama administration officials were in touch with several foreign countries during the campaign and the transition. but there is no evidence to suggest that they discussed policy, especially with an 'enemy' nation. there is evidence that offers from foreign countries to discuss sensitive matters were turned down because they were not in government yet. i believe it is as much an ethics issue as it is a political and national security issue. going by the michael flynn case, there is evidence that the trump team did not act ethically. the fbi also needs to look into whether major policy issues have been discussed between the trump team and the russians during the campaign and the transition in return for business favors for the trump company. <S_SEP> yes there does seem to be plentiful real evidence of contacts, but as masha gessen points out in her recent nyrb piece (see <a href="http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/06/trump-russia-conspiracy-trap/" title="http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/06/trump-russia-conspiracy-trap/" target="_blank">http://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/06/trump-russia-conspiracy-trap/</a> ), with the exception of hacking, many or even all of these contacts may very well turn out to have been of such minor consequence as to render the whole russia furore a tempest in a teapot, intelligence and media assertions notwithstanding. meanwhile other more serious instances of malfeasance take a back seat by comparison. <S_SEP> even if trump was simply naive--he is fatally tainted as our voice both because of the universal assumption that he is beholden to russia, and because he lies. but trump micromanages and gambles that he can say anything and get away with it.<br/><br/>--in referring to flynn's talking to the russian ambassador about sanctions in december, trump said that if he hadn't he would have told him to. <S_SEP> what i don't understand is why trump would list the loans from russia. at first glance, obviously for a deduction and i assume a foreign loan qualities. it seems though that he wouldn't want to disclose something that pointed to any nefarious actions on his part. and , as it was confirmed by earlier releases of his past tax returns, he's free of paying taxes for the next several years so why do a deduction at all. if the times or some savy reader would give an explanation then any doubts could be alleviated.<br/> the sessions recusal was done deliberately by this sly political from alabama. he volunteered that infamous response to franken's query so that he could recuse himself from the russian investigation but still remain as attorney general. remember he didn't tell trump of his decision to recuse so he could get out of that tar baby investigation eventually ruining his professional career and/or find himself caught up in the coverup.. and in all likelihood saw to the leaks that made his recusal a fait accompli. <S_SEP> just like in watergate, history repeats itself: "follow the money!" trump's relationships with alfa bank, his failed hotel project in baku (which is likely in violation of the fcpa), and his over-priced, out of market sale for $100 mm of a house in palm beach to a russian oligarch, dmitry rybolovlev (with ties to the kremlin), all point to his reliance on russia to support his business, lifestyle, and worse, his campaign. now, he's almost certainly conflicted as president allowing his affinity toward russia to dictate policy.<br/><br/>that's why he can't criticize russia because trump will not "bite the hand that feeds him." <S_SEP> the russians must have been alarmed that they were dealing with such incompetent partners. one or two partners would have been sufficient for a real clandestine operations. that trump's administration required contacts by "at least a half dozen" suggests that trump was so gleeful about his new found influence that he babbled to his various campaign cronies in the same way as he tweets:<br/>"i got it in the bag, the russkies are going to sink hilary and podesta with some huge baggage." <S_SEP> why is it so hard to trace the source of mortgages, liens and other loans and transactions on trump properties? was russian hot money laundered through israel and other tax havens?<br/>trumps desperation may mean that trump co's were, at some point, were in default or technical default on the rusky loans, and they have just been tolerant in exchange for some political deals.<br/>otherwise its the auction hammer and rough sleeping for trump and co. <S_SEP> why else create the wiretap story but as a pre-emptive strike against any evidence the justice dept. may have, or ultimately obtain, that directly connects the president with the russians prior to the election? preposterous, sure, but plenty good for the faithful. perhaps he was telling the truth after all, and there was a 400lb guy sitting on a bed...in trump tower. <S_SEP> i wonder if there is any relationship between trump's campaign ties with russia and the recent russian money-laundering schemes that were reported today in the guardian.
trump has done enough to bury any other president 10 fold. what is the intelligence people waiting for? if not soon ,we will be destroyed. he is weakening every agency by replacing or reducing budgets... epa, education ,state department, hud, . and now he is getting into china with his businesses. when does it stop! he even has his own small protection company...as a business. he is draining the coffers for his own personal wealth. <S_SEP> let us all hope that the beginning of the end for donald trump has now commenced. he forevermore will be used as the standard for what one doesn't do to become, or to be a president of the united states of america. ignorance, lies and dishonesty have no place in the white house. it should be rooted out and removed. a president should be for all the people, with the best interests of the country always at the forefront. donald trump, in a very short period of time, has proven that he's not up to the job. he needs to go. sadly, he's not the first dishonest president, nor will he be the last, but, our system of governance can hopefully be trusted to sort out the good from the bad. let us all hope that honesty prevails and that donald trump is soon sent on his way. <S_SEP> with every passing day, every ridiculous tweet, and every lie trump or his spokesperson spicer or counselor conway try to pass off as the truth, this administration reminds me more and more of richard nixon's circa 1973. given that trump makes nixon look like an amateur and everything moves much faster today, i have to wonder if trump can survive even one full year. <S_SEP> it's hard to believe that america has elected a mentally deranged, delusional narcissist as president. it's sad to watch daily events as he lines his pockets with tax dollars in one form or another while on a mission to reduce or eliminate so many worthwhile programs and departments in the fields of healthcare, the environment, and education. trump is a dangerous man embracing the dark side just like a star wars episode, fully acting out the role of darth vader, ruler of the universe. except...this is for real, thanks to the legions of republicans and their fat cat donors who have sold out this nation to the highest bidders. wake up folks...this movie is still playing and the ending does not look good except for the one percent oligarchy who have taken over. it's time for all citizens to join the resistance. <S_SEP> thankyou!! my god, what's it gonna take for them to get rid of him? they're using him to get what they want with no shame. tax returns please!!!! <S_SEP> what we fail to factor into trump's deranged protestations is that his tight knit family may have been in on it too. what kind of man draws his children into collusion, makes them accessories to treason?<br/>as the walls close in on trump, his minions and his children, expect his desperation to expand exponentially.<br/>remember that all bullies are cowards. and the severity of the wrath of a bully is directly proportionate to the amount of inner turmoil and fear they harbor.<br/>trump will scramble to start a war, probably with north korea, to distract us and save his head.<br/>his tweets only alert intelligent people to his lack of credibility, while is waning audience of supporters will not last through a full disclosure of the truth.<br/>gird your loins, y'all. it's about to get really ugly down in here.<br/><br/>whenever i look at the trump kids, i see the madoff children. <br/><br/>no wonder melania doesn't want to move to dc. moving is a pain in the neck, even if someone else is doing it for you. why move when you know you're going to have to move again when you husband and step kids all go to jail? <S_SEP> forget it. the trail has gone cold and nobody in washington is interested in seeing one of their own, even if it's donald trump, get caught up in criminal charges for the kind of behavior they all participate in when it suits them. we're stuck with trump for four years. focus on health care, which matters, the military spending we don't need, the stupid wall.... <S_SEP> toddlers and young children will lie themselves into an irrational corner, imagining that repeated denial suffices for truth. trump et al are no different. the rest of the world can see this farce; we are waiting for his fragile ego - and house of cards - to be swept aside by the light of investigation and relentless pressure from americans who know better. <S_SEP> president trump is obviously no respecter of the truth. when is he credible? incredible? non-credible? simply beyond belief and human comprehension?<br/><br/>perhaps jeremy shapiro, a research director for the european council on foreign relations, can help us resolve the issue: "it's very easy to have a good meeting with trump, it's very pleasant and he's very pleasant in person. he'll promise you the world, and 48 hours later, he'll betray you without a thought. he won't even know he'll be betraying you."<br/><br/>in his fleeting present, mr. trump says what he feels and feels what he says. when he thereafter contradicts a former utterance--when he contradicts even often repeated campaign promises to his base--he should fall back on his most credible defense: president trump's attention span is so short as to be negligible. perhaps this also explains his disregard for facts, broken campaign promises, disengagement from reality and disrespect for the truth. he is simply incapable of synthesizing his experience to the point that facts, fidelity, reality and truth matter.<br/><br/>the majority of humans enter a similar state only when sedated.<br/><br/>trump, perhaps, habitually lies and sleep-bullies his way through life?<br/><br/>trump clearly dwells in a twitterverse all his own. he tweets even while committee hearings are underway.<br/><br/>president trump's short attention span, his narcissism, his paranoia and his disengagement from reality combine to make him psychologically and temperamentally unfit for office. <S_SEP> richard luettgen: you are unaware it seems about the depth and breadth of trump's family and entourage's ties to russia. plenty of publicly available information out there to show multiple forms of collusion. plenty of evidence that trump is a pathological liar, but he's stated in the media that he barely knows felix sater or putin for that matter. the man lies like he breathes. <br/><br/>how unfortunate our infotainment outlets missed the signs so long ago. can our 4th estate redeem itself now? <S_SEP> so many convolutions in the spoutings of trump that any possibility seems probable. i like the thought that his business ties loom large. it is frightening in any case. when will we hear impeach? <S_SEP> the way i see it, trump is like the sports equipment store guy in sopranos, and the russians have ordered a lot of pianos on his imploding business, so the singing better get started or junior's gonna blow another casket.
one simple question for those who feverishly cling to the notion that trump collaborated with russia to hack the election: given russia's sophisticated data gathering tools, why didn't they hack hillary's server and release the 33,000 obviously damaging emails she scrubbed while they were under subpoena? <br/><br/>podesta was hacked not by any technological wizardry, but because he fell for a primitive phishing scam. would the russians, if they were in a conspiracy with trump, stop there, even if they were in fact responsible for the phishing?<br/><br/>yet kristof and other intellectually challenged commenters on the left continue to ignore this elephant in the room.<br/><br/>again, why didn't russia, if they wanted trump to win, hack hillary's server and expose her emails? until you credibly answer that, all your flailing about dots and what not, is just that, flailing. <S_SEP> it would be good to see the nyt present an integral, coherent theory of what it believes the russian attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election was. did they try to tamper with votes? plant false information? hack e-mail servers and reveal what people in the democratic party establishment were really up to? so far what i have seen centers on the third, and i haven't heard any complaints yet that what was revealed wasn't true. but yes, hacking email servers is a serious thing especially when it is done at the direction of a foreign government, worse yet if it is done in collusion with a domestic campaign organization, and it is right that it be investigated. if anyone in trump's team played a role they should be prosecuted, including trump himself. but the gray lady should understand why she is gray and not get any ideas of wearing white to the wedding. <S_SEP> i still haven't found an answer to the fundamental question of whether hillary folks also had contact with russian (or ukrainian) officials during the campaign? i'm also curious to know to what extent we engage in cyber-hacking of russia and others. how extensive is this among the world's major countries? here's one, is the only major difference between russia's attempted hacking of the dnc and the rnc is that only the dnc fell for it? we need some perspective for all this before passing sweeping judgement. <S_SEP> a question we should all take a moment to think about: <br/><br/>if the cia, an institution known world wide for it's cyber-tech savvy, is vulnerable to penetration of its top-secret vaults containing the ultimate secrets of their trade craft, what does that say about the security of our electronic voting systems? decades old electronic voting platforms running on decades old software, that were hastily built and implemented after the 2000 bush v gore debacle.<br/><br/>cyber security experts at the institute for critical infrastructure technology put out last year a book "hacking elections is easy" where their cyber security researchers went through the entire inventory of electronic voting platforms being used and tested them for vulnerability to hacking. shockingly (or maybe not so shocking) they discovered that most of these electronic voting machines could be hacked. some could be hacked within two minutes. at least one system could be hacked from another room, wirelessly, and have its data manipulated.<br/><br/>so again the question: if the cia's most secret data can be hacked, who can say (for sure) our last election was not hacked? and that the date was manipulated to show the votes going to trump instead of clinton?<br/>seems like this cia hack signals a clear and present danger to yet another attack surface our enemies can exploit to subvert american democracy. <S_SEP> how can you be sure that the fbi email hillary flip flop didn't result in a surplus of sympathy votes for hillary.maybe she should thank the russians for getting her close.oh <S_SEP> interesting note: manafort was still trump's campaign manager when trump gave his speech calling for the russians to "hack" her emails. <S_SEP> during the campaign clinton was attacked for her use of a private email server at the same time trump's people were russian fellow travelers. which is worse? <S_SEP> i'm pretty sure it was the conclusion of all of our intelligence agencies that russia was involved in several ways, just as they are known to interfere in elections in many countries throughout the world. sometimes it's not possible for the us government to tell the public everything they know because then everyone knows what they know and . . .you wouldn't believe they know it unless they explained in great detail the programs they used to find out and so forth. but it's well established that russia was involved, at first just meddling and then later to actively try to help trump. maybe your question is "did they sway the election?" which is a different question and no one seems interested in the answer to that except trump who in his supreme wisdom seems to know for a fact that russia did not effect the outcome -- because they did not try. the principle involved is that russia should not meddle in the elections of other nations. trump created this false narrative that the question is "did russia effect the outcome of the us election" but the real narrative is "should russia be stopped from interfering in the elections of any country on earth." trump continues to push this narrative that things would be *worse* if hrc had been elected. creating and battling a straw-man enemy as a distraction. must we constantly be told that trump was a pitiful consolation prize. or as his campaign theme song went "you can't always get what you want . . . . . ." <S_SEP> , election, russia and clinton affair this all started by clinton's attempt to hide her corruption by sifting attention to russia hacking. it didn't work hence our president trump but there are still people who believe they can still pull something off whatever that maybe. until someone from anywhere answer's this very important question "what was the hack that cause clinton to lose the election". quit defending corruption, wasting peoples time, and how about giving your president respect. <S_SEP> this is crazy. these guys have got to go. please give me a break, i knew they were lying about wmds in iraq. of course russia has skewed this past election. the whole gang has to go. i'm a house carpenter even i know. <S_SEP> i certainly hope that the new york times is investigating the fact that eight russians have died since the us election. two of those deaths were on east 67th street in manhattan. i do not believe those deaths to be a coincidence.<br/>i believe putin is exerting his power and proving to trump that he can easily get to people in manhattan. this makes me fear for the journalists who are doing their jobs. please, please, please keep reporting this story !!! thank you.
the united states needs a truly independent investigation of the 2016 election process done by people who are "untouchable." then, the truth should be publicized and let the chips fall where they may. nothing less will be enough to extract us from this mess.<br/><br/>neither party should be able to "guide" the direction of the investigation, or cut it off if it's going to be an embarrassment to anyone. find out what really happened and tell us.<br/><br/>none of this "you can't handle the truth!" business should be accepted. <S_SEP> without a special independent prosecutor - if one can be found - how can we ever have hopes of a free and honest election? this country is being run by a liar in chief with all his little indians nodding their bobble heads in affirmation of his actions. a minority of u.s. voters placed a congenitally sick incompetent in the white house and the majority must now suffer the consequences. well you might ask how this happened. <S_SEP> a full rigorous and independent investigation could begin the process of finding out what transpired in the 2016 would not only restore the faith and confidence of the american electorate it would bein the process of rehabilitating the damaged credibility of the us globally <S_SEP> colluding with a foreign power to influence an election and lying under oath aren't scandalous? who knew. <S_SEP> this is almost like whistleblowing on your boss. will the process allow for this to be played out or be shut down by doj management? <br/><br/>by the way, why wasn't this provided to the public before the election like hrc's alleged misdeeds? <S_SEP> keep up the pressure on the scandal and the truth may merge. there is sure a lot of smoke. must be a fire. <S_SEP> the truth is less important than blocking information to the public. amazing <S_SEP> the continuing belief that republicans have any intention of sharing power with democrats or anyone else as the constitution requires are naive. the only honest way out of this mess is through a special prosecutor, but the chances that this is going to happen are minimal if not completely absent. the autocratic thinking that now pervades two branches of our government and, with gorsuch's confirmation, will soon pervade the third, will keep truth on this and many other matters hidden. there will be no special prosecutor and republicans are already circling the wagons around our ersatz president. media, despite good intentions, continue to jump from lie to lie in frenzied gotcha fashion, keeping the public confused and disorganized while fox news functions as america's state-sponsored news outlet and dominates information with alt-facts propaganda. meanwhile, we will continue to believe and behave as if things were operating in a business-as-usual manner until lord donald assumes the throne and people everywhere are aghast because they had no idea this was happening! <S_SEP> it is clear and repugnant to see not only the president but also the attorney general lying in such a shameful way. as the editorial points out this administration, “has shown a proclivity to lie, mislead and obfuscate with startling audacity.”<br/>when will this entire embarrassing nightmare come to an end? every day it seems we are getting closer to either an impeachment for lying and subverting the constitutional order or being declared mentally insane and ethically incompetent, as well as morally inept. the sooner the better, for america’s sake. <S_SEP> i agree entirely. i can't say why there is no serious work being done to get to the bottom of this. i'm not a conspiracy theorist, but there are plenty out there, including trump himself, and i have not heard from them on this issue. <S_SEP> obviously trump is "lying about it". 1) the arrangement was designed to give him "deniability", so he's playing that card to the hilt. 2) contradicting that is that his management style is tightly controlling, so his subordinates do not play games on their own. 3) since laws were probably broken, the deniability will break down as investigators pile on culpable parties until one or more of them cracks under pressure. 4) at that point trump will be exposed as party to the crime and as lying to federal investigators, impeding justice. 5) that is impeachable. so good luck with the "deniability" tactic, mr. president.
look the fact is trumpster desires to be just like putin. a dictator whose every word and whim is carried out. there is no free press in russia to criticize putin or even question his actions, opposition politicians mysteriously end up dead, he's amassed trillions of dollars in shady business deals and no one questions him. give trumpster and his supporters enough time and as long as he has enough spineless republicans it'll happen here too <S_SEP> bingo.<br/>no one thought trump would win, so it will not be surprising to eventually find out that his surrogates saw any attention from the russians as simply 'good for future business.' also given trump's propensity for ruthlessness, any advantage he thought he could gain in the election by capitalizing on putin's interference would be 'fair game' in his book.<br/><br/>and finally, as most journalists are now starting to point out, being picked up on a wire tap because you're talking to the russians (who would be wire tapped) does not mean you are the target...you're second hand smoke.<br/><br/>isn't it obvious then that only in trump's maniacal mind would he make such tapping about him vs them.<br/><br/>this onion really stinks the more layers you pull off. <S_SEP> there is no love lost between russia and the blue states of america. i often wonder whether if trump had lost there could have been such an overzealous attempt at the russian connection and more precisely putin's connection to the 2016 presidential election. putin is undoubtedly one of the most powerful leaders in the world today. he has done everything to restore russian pride lost after the collapse of the soviet union and has exerted influence over the those countries that were previously within the sphere of influence of the ussr. the russian people are not our enemies and should not be victims of dislike by our politicians. a good working relation between russia and the usa even if putin remains at the helm is mutually beneficial for both our countries and for world peace and space exploration. the editorial board (eb) unlike independents like me is biased against trump because it wholeheartedly endorsed gov kasich in the republican primary and sec. clinton in the general and has been spinning all revelations, polls and news to indulge in trump bashing. now it is comey bashing and trying to insinuate that comey cannot be impartial. simply because, the candidate the eb endorsed lost and according to the eb, it lost because either the russian hacking or influence or comey's influence and until eb finds anyone especially comey to support their wishful thinking the eb will stretch this story and haunt americans on trump and russia. this trivial and biased pursuit has to end. <S_SEP> "because putin ..... didn’t imagine that trump could actually win."<br/><br/>this is probably true and probably explains why the russians were so sloppy.<br/>it is also probably true that a quid-pro-quo will not be found, but that doesn't excuse treason in the act and the ongoing cover-up. <br/><br/>how much did trump know? how much does he remember? his reality seems quite flexible to current circumstances and he may genuinely "not recall", a phrase i am sure we will hear repeatedly from many should an investigation ever include sworn testimony. <S_SEP> the first thing putin did when he took power was to discredit and hobble the media. sound familiar? this is an open plea to the (not-failing, and not fake news) nyt and other legitimate media outlets - do not let this crook trump and his gop cronies, (who are only interested in making themselves richer), get away with turning america into an authoritarian state. john mccain is right, those who don't remember the lessons of the past are doomed to repeat them. <S_SEP> the only motives the megalomaniac ignoramus has on russia, or shall i say ru$$ia, is money: hotels, golf courts, casinos, etc. etc.<br/>on the other hand, due to his predatory background, it would not surprise me if vladimir has a big dossier with photographs on his past activities. <S_SEP> , russia and trump affair "the fourth explanation is the flimsiest: the idea, contained in a dossier compiled by private investigators, that russia has compromising material on trump. unless real evidence emerges, i’d encourage you to ignore this theory.<br/><br/>the final possible motive — an ideological alliance — is in some ways the most alarming. "<br/><br/>not at all. if there is indeed evidence that supports the fourth explanation, then that would be by far the most alarming. if trump is compromised (aka blackmailed) then he would be willing to do anything - and i do mean anything - to make sure that he is never found out. <br/><br/>yes, there may not be evidence, but if so, then it would be far worse than an ideological alliance. he could be persuaded to do whatever it took to satisfy his russian masters. <S_SEP> while it is true that there is no evidence of compromising material in russian hands that does not mean it is the "flimsiest" of possibilities. after all the compromising material could of course confirm the other theories or could be something else altogether. the idea that putin could scandalize trump if he failed to advance russian friendly (or at least neutral) policies is very much consistent with pro forma russian methodology. but business ties alone would likely not be serious enough to sink trump. nor would ideological sympathy with putin be sufficient for trump to be so complimentary especially since it adds little to his base and peels off many who might otherwise support him. and of course trump's explanation that good relations with russia are in our national interest is also not a winner electorally, and i am not inclined to think he is demonstrating moral character. that leaves election meddling or compromising material or some combination thereof. fasten your seatbelts, its gonna be a bumpy ride. <S_SEP> while discussing some possible grand geopolitical objectives to explain why putin has been so enthusiastic in helping trump to get elected, americans seem to be missing one simple putin's motivation. putin, who represents a circle of his oligarchic sidekicks and his partners in crime, has vested interests in having trump in the wh for at least four years. he sees trump as a guarantor of that clique's ill-gotten riches parked in the west. as a result of tremendous capital flight from russia, over $1 trillion in cash has accumulated on thousands of off-shore accounts, in the most expensive real estate in new-york and london, gigantic yachts, etc. net capital outflows in russia in 2015 alone were $151.5 billion! putin and his clique are in constant fear over losing their loot. american dept. of treasury holds its finger on the control switch and can activate freezing their assets anytime. they had no doubts that if elected hillary clinton would turn that switch on. that is why putin desperately needed a self-appointed american oligarch and tax-evading "friend" in washington with vulnerable business past who can be easily manipulated. <S_SEP> i don't buy that there was no quid pro quo between trump and the russians. the russians knew it was possible trump could win especially with their help. it would have been greatly to their advantage to persuade trump that they could make him president. then the screwy "forget about russian aggression in ukraine" plank showed up at the republican convention. the truth is hiding in plain sight. <S_SEP> every tweet by donald trump, every hostile statement by sean spicer, and every tv talking point by kellyanne conway that attempts to divert attention from a legitimate fbi investigation into undue russian influence simply adds to the suspicion that trump and his associates have something to hide. his supporters will never see it that way, but any clear-thinking american has to wonder if our president isn't beholden to a foreign adversary.
well said! i couldn't agree more. and the democrat party establishment still needs to learn about the power of the people, as we saw in the democratic national committee chair person elections, where they voted in another insider <S_SEP> totally agree and haven't heard too many bring that topic up. of course that will never get by either republican run branch. <S_SEP> shall we add to this list how important it is not to openly diminish and be condescending toward large parts of the electorate? and how important it is actually to get down into democratic processes and to acknowledge their legitimacy, to reason and deliberate and follow the hard path, the long arc--to acknowledge the fact that elites cannot simply dictate and denounce? the nyt has a long ways to go with this. <S_SEP> the constitution does not require political parties to share power. there is no article, clause, section in the constitution which even remotely says that. political parties themselves are not mentioned, at all, in the constitution. the democrats, when they held a super-majority in the second term of bush, did not share power. why should you expect the republicans to do so? furthermore, the democrats and the intelligence community have now set a very dangerous precedent: that ideological differences may supersede the duties they have to their positions and to this country. that one may now break us law and leak classified information if it means that one strikes a blow to some official they are ideologically against, no matter how high up the ladder that official sits. you can, and should, expect all future elections to see this again, and the republicans would be remiss if they did not employ the same disruptive tactics. bush set a precedent by making obama's transition as smooth as possible, and his efforts are now legendary for their effectiveness. obama and his outgoing officials have done the precise opposite. do not expect the republicans to allow any democratic official to take office without tossing up the same extensive roadblocks at every turn, from now on. you made your bed, democratic party. now lay in it. <S_SEP> gary, you are surely aware of the wealth of democrats and the ties of leaders of the democrats to wall street, right? <S_SEP> oh, honey. the democratic party left behind the ideals of fdr and jfk a long time ago. fdr and jfk would not recognize today's democratic party -- which abandons and mocks the working class, with glee and snark -- and which upholds identity groups over every other value -- which supports gay marriage and "transgender rights" and unisex bathrooms.<br/><br/>today, fdr and jfk would be republicans. <S_SEP> be honest; did you expect a trump/republican government to get anything constructive done?<br/>all they know is destruction and chaos. they are incapable of anything positive. <S_SEP> democrats need to start thinking about the end game. impeaching or forcing the resignation of djt might leave an ultra conservative and fairly competent president pence in power, with aligned judicial and legislative branches. they could inflict enormous damage on the usa.<br/>beware of what you wish for. <S_SEP> "the goal must be to make american political parties and democratic institutions less vulnerable to efforts to distort the electoral process."<br/><br/>and to convict any criminals. <S_SEP> the right has been diligently working very hard to distort the electoral process for some time now. i am of the impression that as long as whatever distortion, irregardless of questionable ethics, works to advance the party, it in their view is all good. <br/><br/>the swamp is now so full of slime that it is oozing stink bubbles from the depths. trump and his republican congress are the result of a statement gone horribly awry. <br/><br/>as a nation we are appearing as more and more petty and foolish with each passing day of this self righteous bumbling administration. <S_SEP> wow. you are really certain you are right. you are an example of the problem with right wing extremists which is that they know so little they don't know how little they know.
<br/>my vote goes to motives second and third. the results of the investigations of the trump-putin presidential election and, the disclosure of the president's tax returns will enlighten us. the political motive to take office and the economic reasons to quench his thirst for wealth.<br/><br/>motives one and five are very good but you are assuming a depth of though that is missing in trump world. i do not think the president understands geopolitics and ideology represents a commodity.<br/><br/>finally, the third motive did not get my vote because we already had a dose of that with the recordings of trump grabbing women. this motive would be the same but in video mode. <S_SEP> the motive isn't really the issue. the issue is that trump is a clear and present danger to the national security of the united states. <br/><br/>it's a hell of a thing to say about the president of the united states. <S_SEP> most of the motives suggested probably apply to some degree, but i believe that in the end they all rest on a foundation of ego and greed. trump has always put trump first and that means pursuing profit wherever it may be found. he has not been bothered by ethics or laws. he considers himself smart and his best evidence for that may be his accomplishments as a schemer. trump believes he can out-scheme anyone. to understand trump follow his ego to the money. to find the money, uncover the schemes. <S_SEP> remember watergate --- "follow the money." item no. 9 of your list is critical. also it is public record that trump was at the very least running his stupid beauty pageants in russia with putin's involvement so there is at least this prior history of financial dealings.<br/>tax returns are necessary but they are only a starting point. do not be fooled into thinking that they will tell all. other information on the money links are necessary.<br/>also don't forget about trump's outrageous public urging of russia to hack into clinton's emails. so he even made at least one public ask for this sort of interference. and it happened. there is no denying that. <S_SEP> trump's craziness and his russian connection may have a positive lesson.<br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<br/>trump suggests to me that benefits of comparative politics and personal political storytelling. <br/><br/>during the obama years, things got down, but much of it was cut and dried, and rather dull and uneventful. now, with trump, the smallest detail can become interesting and debatable.<br/><br/>obama gave good speeches, but they were rarely memorable. he spoke a lot, but he did not use power point visual aids, animations, etc to make his points. and hillary was just plain dull and defensive in her campaign.<br/><br/>perhaps we should be thankful to donald tump for the interest he brings.<br/>======================================================= <S_SEP> and what motivates so many republicans to turn a blind eye to trump's treachery and possible treason? <S_SEP> motives assume rationality. look at p.t. trump's enablers, and it's easy to see the futility of explanations. <S_SEP> somewhere deep in the fbi or cia someone or some group is sitting on a lot of dots of information that could bring this presidency down---could be videos, could be laundered money, could be money and videos---at what point does that someone or some group connect the dots. <S_SEP> i believe putin intended to do more than just wound ms. clinton.<br/>perhaps if we knew exactly how much money and resources mr. putin spent to flip our election we would better appreciate what he expected to buy for his money. <S_SEP> the one i favor is that both are oligarchs. russia treated trump as a king when he visited. for trump, that is all it takes for him to be your bff.
fbi always investigates russian communications. that wasn't a wiretap and is not proof of a wiretap. that was communications between 2 computers, much different. had nothing to do with trump's phone. <S_SEP> during watergate, republicans were able to momentarily let politics take back seat to what was best for the country. those days seem gone forever. now they are circling the wagons around 45 pretending that news leaks are "the" story. <br/><br/>and what can we expect from comey? he testified with a straight face how the f.b.i. was under constraints as to what it could be revealed publicly, e.g. names of actual individuals currently under investigation, seemingly having forgotten the hatchet job he personally administered to clinton just days before the election. we can only hope he now has a severe case of buyer's remorse. <S_SEP> i watched every minute of the hearing today and was really struck by one moment and one thought. when mr. comey was explaining that it was rare for the fbi to announce there was an ongoing investigation, i thought back to when he felt it was so important that the american people learn that maybe, just maybe, there might be some hillary emails on anthony weiner's server. at that same time he knew he was investigating the trump campaign for connections to the russians and putin. weiner, as gross as he is, does not begin to have the gravitas of a russian connection. how could comey not have seen that the american electorate might be interested in the trump/russian connection? a weiner or a putin. one is much easier for us to digest. <S_SEP> i don't understand, comey already colluded to derail clinton's campaign, so why is he looking at trump and russia? is he only trying to reform his image as a treasonous pawn? <S_SEP> so the fbi is investigating trump and has entire transcripts of his conversations with foreign leaders, but then claims he wasn't wire tapped?!?! so those transcripts magically appeared??!?!? guess there are some people who will believe anything they are told...... <S_SEP> i have little confidence in the fbi investigations and less in the senate intelligence. unless someone in the media digs up the truth as in watergate, we will find the truth years from now. <S_SEP> well, now we know why assange is giving cia a kick in the halls, for having the goods on trump. sounds like trump's folks got caught up in our surveillance of russians!! you don't need a warrant to capture that, but you may have to open an investigation to look any further at what the prism guards are holding. tempora comes from the uk without any content, so you'd have to ask the five eyes for that before it goes bad. 30 days. <S_SEP> comey has now acknowledged that there is a serious investigation into the trump administration's ties to russia. the president is being investigated for treason. conley cannot comment on any of it.<br/><br/>but why could comey so willfully comment on the fbi's investigation of hillary clinton's emails at a key moment during the champaign?<br/><br/>an independent investigation of this entire matter is absolutely necessary to restore public trust, and the gop needs to stop obfuscating and deflecting. we are beyond that nonsense now. <S_SEP> , russians blackmailed trump here's where you start and finish; everything in the british former intelligence officer's dossier is true. and jane doe v. trump and epstein; trump raped a 13 year old girl and he's done it frequently. the russians blackmailed trump and all of his disgusting buddies (now white house staff and cabinet officials). the sad thing? the rapes don't and won't count but the fbi will get him on the money that he took from russia when no one else would loan to him. you know, i cannot even 'unsubscribe' to whitehouse.gov's emails - i've tried several times. what does that tell you?! <S_SEP> at the least, someone with law knowledge should file a suit against the government for malfeasance at the fbi. comey was visited by republican office holders before he made his hillary comments. did they scare that comment out of him? or is he so self-incriminatingly stupid to implicate trump today? <br/><br/>just another stupid fed.
, russia, trump there is no choice other than to oppose trump at every step. the man is delusional - making stuff about sweden? sometimes i wonder if he is just becoming senile - or his memory is going. did he hear something on one of his late night broadcasts about sweden and not quite remember what he heard. so he plugged in own narrative? the problem is that trump seems to have been lying to the press since he was young. i watched him on tv last week very carefully when he was denying any connection with russia at all - and it looked believable. then about two days later the ny times came out with the article about how his various associates were regularly communicating with russian representatives during the election - and also that he had worked on a project (that did not come to fruition) for a building in moscow. so this man lies very convincingly. a total creep - who has taken us down the road to fascism. <S_SEP> there's push-back from folks saying people are going all conspiracy theory regarding the trump team's ties to russia. so glad mr. kristof clearly lays out the contacts and what's at stake. trump never ever, ever does anything for good or altruistic motives and if he wasn't saber rattling with russia during the campaign or now, it's because he had good, self-serving reasons not too. i hope the trump presidency ends with him leaving office in disgrace before his term is up. the only good he is capable of is the resistance his noxious actions have inspired. <S_SEP> it's more than that. if he has lied about his involvements, he should be removed either for violating his oath of office, or for mental instability and inability to conduct the responsibilities of office.<br/><br/>ever watch the west wing? of nearly 600 positions, he has filled 45. the offices are empty -- business cannot be done ... and he is playing golf or tweeting about a bogus news article on fox.<br/><br/>btw ... why isn't more attention devoted to the fact that the fox report on crime in sweden was fabricated -- presenting answers to some questions as though they were responsive to completely different questions.<br/><br/>why does fox retain it's fcc license in the face of this kind of flagrant lying? <S_SEP> he lies exactly the way a very young child lies. kids 2-4 years old lie as part of their normal development, though. they are beginning to learn that their minds are separate from their parents. trump never outgrew that stage; indeed, it became a lifelong behavior for him and he has even admitted to habitual lying (it's on tape somewhere, not something made up by the nyt or any other news outlet). if everyone would just listen to recordings of trump on tv and radio shows going back 40 years, they'd get this and his support base would shrink dramatically. <S_SEP> it's only a matter of time before the truth emerges. there is a huge "i told you so" waiting in the wings for all those trump supporters who put their faith in this most corrupt egomaniac with his treasonous ties to russia. <S_SEP> mr kristoff, your #2 mentions no obvious links between trump campaign officials and russia, yet this july 18 story in the washington post reports one link, which was to alter language in the gop platform in such a way as to favor russia ... of course, there may be others but this connection is from a reputable news company ... otherwise, thx for the many dots!

what goes around sometimes comes around! <S_SEP> the current crisis we are mired in would have been unthinkable 20 years ago.<br/><br/>the serial liar criminal fake president is enriching himself and causing problems on a daily basis because of freaks like paul ryan and mitch mcconnell. it's really that simple; in a different era their political lives would have ended if they had supported this dolt.<br/><br/>not sure what james comey told the gang of eight on friday but since he handed the election to trump on a platter i don't see anything other than an independent commission solving this terrible crime.<br/><br/>trump is a thug and no one who has the power to stop him seems interested in doing so. why is that?
trump is a virtual artists palate of the elements of histrionic and narcissistic personality disorder traits. choosing all five of the possible explanations in some combo seems to best explain his strange case of russophilia. asto motive....<br/><br/>people with histrionic pd engage in dramatic actions that ensure they will be heard, they crave excitement and act on impulse and suggestion, often leading to exploitation. they come across as insincere. combined with the self absorbed narcissist who needs to be admired, while lacking empathy, it seems putin's russia offers trump both a goal and a mirror. <br/><br/>motives are secondary, psychological state should be our primary concern. our president trump has a serious personality disorder....grab the tail and hold on.....this is going to be a wild ride. <S_SEP> there is, in addition to the five motives mentioned in david leonhardt's opinion piece, a sixth pro-russian/pro-putin motive. trump needs and thrives on adoration, his most powerful motive after money. putin recognizes this weakness in our president and has used this basic trumpian need to his (putin's) advantage. <S_SEP> you left out the possibility that trump is being or has been cultivated and played.<br/><br/>don't spies 'turn' people like this?<br/><br/>a narcissist is way too vulnerable to flattery -- look at the ongoing "campaign" events which dt needs to re-convince himself he is loved by his base, as everyone but his base is marching in protest of his chaotic, amateurish first month. <S_SEP> russia's involvement in this last election is the only explanation for this incompetent, thin-skinned fool to have been elected. he is so self- absorbed and immature that he doesn't see how his tweets and comments make him look: guilty as all get-up. <S_SEP> and one more.<br/>trump is the unwitting patsy whose presence on the world stage as the instigator of american introversion and distraction has been engineered by russia. the goal is domination of europe and asia, the play is to remove american interest in these with an america-first version of the producers. trump may know nothing. investigate instead those who whisper and direct him. <S_SEP> i hope mr. kristof is correct that trump's unhinged behavior is an attempt to distract us from the president's russia connections, as opposed to his engaging in the only behavior he knows how to. because even a shrewd manipulator would be preferable to a completely delusional incompetent. <S_SEP> i personally think it is not as simple as one motive but rather a path trump followed that involves a little of each.<br/><br/>i think trump going back 30 years found himself in a position where he could not borrow money and needed sources of investment, "other peoples' money". he became a hyped brand more than anything else. he has no morals, and there is a trail of russian and former soviet republic cash. i think trump's luxury hotels and other real-estate deals are ways for corrupt oligarchs to launder large amounts of cash.<br/><br/>after getting into this situation, i think it is very likely he managed to become compromised by illicit and perverted sexual escapades in russia. remember, his image is everything, including for his tv show. it is possible if not proven yet.<br/><br/>having many illicit, corrupt ties, once he decided to run for president, people like manafort and page and others attached themselves to it hoping to profit. flynn saw a possibility for his own agenda, which is primarily to pull russia away from iran so that we can confront what he views as the biggest culprit.<br/><br/>as for ideology, i don't think trump has any, but he also does not value democracy. he will merge his personal ambitions, and his desire to amass wealth, with the presidency. democracy stands in his way, and he sees corruption in russia and elsewhere that he will embrace if it benefits him.<br/><br/>he has no morals, no values, no character. just selfish greed. <S_SEP> i would not be surprised to see putin wait awhile longer and then drop a dime on trump- maybe a year down the road. then, he could sit back and just watch the chaos. he seems to enjoy chaos. <S_SEP> i would place the 5th factor listed in the article, ideological alliance, as number one. putin appears to be a hero to white supremacists and other extreme cultural conservatives throughout the west. the very fabric of our constitution and its resulting institutions is at great risk of disappearing under the boot of trump's covert confederacy. at some point fox news and its more moderate republicans audience will need to decide whether the american experiment is worth preserving. the rest of us can kick and scream, but it will be up to them. <S_SEP> great enumeration of possible motives, but don't forget the element of manipulation - trump could just be fawning over putin in response to putin's flattery of him, a shallow, manipulative flattery, but highly effective to one so susceptible to attention.
, russia and ukraine affair this suggestion of a select committee and special investigation makes sense. time and again yesterday the republicans on what was supposed to be a nonpartisan hearing tried to defend trump instead of obtain clear information. their entire purpose seemed to be to act as a defensive line for trump. they suggested that hillary clinton's campaign had ties with russia despite the obvious ludicrousness of having clinton/russia collusion when comey said repeatedly that russia wanted to harm clinton. they suggested on the one hand that the leaks themselves were from russian agents (again absurd), and they seemed to think that leaks were a far more serious crime than treason. they tried to get the admiral and comey to not declare the truth, that russia is an adversary of the united states. they also tried to mask how serious the changes by trump people to the republican platform were by not quoting the changed passage about ukraine.<br/><br/>i was surprised, frankly, at how desperately the republicans at the hearing tried to protect trump and switch to one of their habitual witch hunts against democrats. ten years ago or more, that would not have happened. there would have been honorable patriotic republicans concerned about treason and protecting the integrity of democratic elections and not protecting top level russophiles like trump and his people.<br/><br/>that republicans would run interference like this means only an independent prosecutor has credibility. <S_SEP> dear mr. rod rosenstein,<br/>i am not waiting for a bi-partisan request from congress. i urge you to appoint a special prosecutor now, today, as soon as possible. as this editorial points out, the administration will certainly want their claim that there was no collusion substantiated as quickly and transparently as possible. it will be a service to all for you to proceed decisively without waiting for a hobbled congress to provide clear direction. history is watching. yours truly, with sincere gratitude and best wishes, marjorie. <S_SEP> , national commission, co-chairpersons i would think that the best solution would be a special prosecutor appointed only after a national commission does it's work. if criminal charges must be brought it can always be referred to doj and the special prosecutor by the commission. <br/><br/>the national commission is the only way to cover all aspects of the russian attack: not just the administrations possible collusion. it is the only way the public is allowed to stay involved. the intel committees, the special prosecutor all have to remain essentially closed to the public to follow the law &amp; the presumption of innocence. and most certainly the country still has a sour taste in it's mouth after the ken starr experience in the clinton years. but no one felt that way about the 9/11 commission. <br/><br/>take it out of the realm of the politicians and hand over to the acknowledged statesmen. consider colin powell &amp; wesley clark. or george schultz &amp; jerry brown. belive it or not we still have sr. statesmen available in the country. george mitchell &amp; john boehner. think hard about it and suggest your own pair of co-chairpersons. barbara mukulski &amp; christine todd whitman. <br/><br/>essentially the public must stay involved and informed. in real time not after the fact. <S_SEP> the refusal of the republican-controlled congress to opt for an independent investigation of russian influence in the 2016 election is more a scandal than the current f.b.i. investigation. that republicans can pretend that this is not warranted is harmful to the ideal of separation of powers in the constitution, why are they protecting a president who brazenly broadcasts false facts about what f.b.i. director comey said in sworn testimony? <S_SEP> i witnessed the extreme partisanship of the gop yesterday during this hearing- namely, the gop taking a page from the dt playbook and trying to steer the focus away from the actual russian issue to the side issue of leaks. it was breathtaking- but sadly, not at all surprising behavior from the gop.<br/>my advice to the gop- try to portray yourselves as patriots for once and work to get to the bottom of this by appointing a special prosecutor.<br/>dt has a 37% approval rating and his days are numbered- so why ruin your own careers over supporting his obfuscations? <S_SEP> the gop has dyslexia. they believe gop spells god, thus they are infallible and may do no wrong. their is more circumstantial evidence to show that russian involvement in the election gave trump the victory and that there may be collusion between russian intel and the trump campaign.<br/>but the gop cares only about finding the leaks, as if that is the problem. if we didn't know this happened we would all be happy with our chito messiah.<br/>they worship the false idol of hypocrisy.<br/>they need to hold djt to the same scrutiny they held hrc. if they did he would be impeached before the 4th of july.<br/>they say they are for the common man, djt pack a cabinet of special interests demolition experts to destroy the government and hurt the very people who supported them.<br/>let 2018 be the great reckoning. <S_SEP> mr. krystof:<br/><br/>the integrity of the american electoral process is of paramount importance and it is essential that this matter be thoroughly investigated and that the american people have confidence in the result. a crime was definitely committed: the russian government interfered in the 2016 us presidential election with an attempt to discredit the result. what is not clear is whether or not there was collusion by members of mr. trump's campaign team, including by mr. trump himself. only a thorough but rapid and apolitical investigation by respected investigators can sort this out to the satisfaction of the american people. the career prosecutors of the us justice department, including the fbi, should be able to do this as long as mr. sessions is recused, which he has done. a special prosecutor does not guarantee an apolitical investigation as we learned from the clinton investigation by ken starr. until sufficient information is obtained to answer this question, "connecting the dots" at this time is pure speculation and is rightly interpreted as part of a partisan political agenda which must be scrupulously avoided if we are to have confidence in the result. if trump is cleared by the investigation, the american people must have confidence that that is the correct result. your column is inimical to justice because it asserts a result before the facts are known. as steve jobs taught us, the dots can be only connected retrospectively, not prospectively. <S_SEP> most of the republicans are cowards, so they will not allow a special prosecutor. end of storyl <S_SEP> wow. that hearing. i watched democracy in america being slowly choked by republicans who vastly prefer an autocratic form of governance. it was supposed to be about russia hacking our democratic voting process. it became about republicans setting up a line of inquiry designed to launch a witch hunt (favorite of theirs, i guess) to find the leak. so, i witnessed that with republicans it is okay to commit treason and collude with foreign manipulators; if we find out about it? put the "leaker" on trial! deplorable? what do people who are true patriots think? is our constitution worth preserving? these republicans apparently beg to disagree. i am worried for our nation. are republicans now the party of russia?
thank you. this is a particularly thoughtful, clear-eyed analysis of what is most likely to be important and what is probably not. i do disagree about sessions, but only to this extent: he did lie, and, particularly in these times when truth is so devalued, it's important not to let him get by with it. that said, i think your focus on manafort makes a worlds of sense. <S_SEP> i agree that ag sessions is a diversion from the real issue which are it appears but needs to be investigated the money trail between foreign governments and people associated with president trump who may have broken the law because they had failed to register as foreign agents, (i noted today that general flynn has belatedly registered), paul manafort is especially interesting because he failed to disclose the funds he had received for his services to a ukrainian faction.<br/><br/>the question that must be addressed is, what harm has this activity brought to the larger security interests of the united states citiizens? clearly, all of the activities must be investigated and the determination made. in the end this will restore the public trust in the congress and the presidency. <S_SEP> ya and that's all well and fine, but this situation is as big as any ever has been! the president of the united states has 0 credibility in washington and is now trying to cover up his involvement by placing directors of agencies as quick as he can to cover up any involvement! the sec of state is heading to moscow? really whats your guess is the sec of state motivation to cancel his meeting with nato? are you watching the news comey said the trump administration is under investigation, we need an independent and i mean independent investigation! saturday night live is going to have a field day with this situation! <S_SEP> treason is the word not mentioned here, but that would be at the heart of any collusion between the trump campaign and the russian government's efforts to interfere in our election to help candidate trump become president. this would be a crime of such magnitude, that only a special prosecutor could be trusted to fully investigate. there is moreover, a high risk of interference with any investigation in which the justice department plays a role. furthermore, the final report must be made public. full stop. <S_SEP> there may or may not be too much focus on sessions. that does not change the fact that he lied to congress. <S_SEP> thank you mr. kristof for reminding us that "coincidences happen." there has been far to much hysteria in the nyt and elsewhere, following every contact with russia by anyone with the remotest connection to the trump side. the sessions connections must be follow up, but it is easy to imagine they might have been just part of his business as a secretary. and his muddled responses to al franken could also have been those of a tired, confused guy eager to make sure those contacts were understandable. <br/><br/>yes, let's connect the dots. draw no conclusions just because we want those conclusions. but be very thorough and diligent. see what we find out. <S_SEP> , moscow donald if i had voted for moscow donald &amp; i was getting anything like the real news from fox-faux news &amp; conservative radio i'm sure i'd be feeling sick to my stomach by now! i'd be thinking to myself that maybe those people who were saying he was a con man look like they were right. i'd be thinking to myself that maybe all the talk that he wasn't the best businessman might have been true as well. that is if they were getting the real story?<br/><br/>for those of us who didn't vote for don the con we were sick the day he won the republican nomination! we got sicker still on election &amp; inauguration days &amp; were quite worried for our country! today it would be easy to say i told you so to all those moscow donald voters but hey they were taken in by a master huckster. but the right thing to be saying is how do we protect our country from this con man &amp; potential traitor. and if any of the president's men did collude with the russians you can certainly say they got their marching orders from the man who asked the russians to go trolling for hilary's emails. <br/><br/>i'll never understand how that statement alone didn't sink his candidacy??? i'll never understand how his statement about grabbing an intimate female body part didn't sink his candidacy??? i'll never understand how his... <S_SEP> you left out the weird answer sessions gave to senator frankenstein in his hearing. he turned a general question into a personal denial. sessions might be a red herring, but no one answers that way unless they know something.<br/>there was also the denials about the republican plank on russia by trump and manafort.<br/>there is also the missing explanations for any of these contacts with russia and the question of why russia and not any other country.<br/>then there is the "i love wikileaks" and the "fat kid" campaign speech comments showing trump was underestimating the gravity of an election hacking. that was followed by his odd paranoid comments about illegal voting and the election being rigged. that all looks like rationalization for cheating in retrospect. there is also the ridiculous party line denial that such collusion influenced the outcome, which it obviously did.<br/>and while you compare these events to house of cards, iran-contra is not that far off, so we have probably set the prior probability of collusion too low. this is probably real and possibly worse than we think. <S_SEP> a special prosecutor is required. trey gaudy demonstrated a determination to misdirect and deceive instead of attending to the devastating catastrophe that trump has visited on america. republicans are incredible, not credible. gorsuch hearings running at the same time as the comey hearings, while the house rushes to end health insurance for millions and give the rich even more tax breaks. garland was refused any hearing or vote, the aca was savaged for 6 years and deliberately damaged in most red states, yet when the fbi testifies that the president lied and is under investigation republicans attempt to drown the outrage by innuendo and unsubstantiated veiled accusations. we must have a special prosecutor if the truth is our goal. trust must be restored.
those of us (many of the "boomer" generation) who recall nixon's sadly failed presidency realize that the present matter has moved beyond the department of justice's ability to investigate. trump has already fired one assistant attorney general. nothing will prohibit him from doing this again (since sessions has recused himself, and could also fall under investigation). trump can fire comey. <br/><br/>we do have honest and earnest republican members of congress (collins, murkowski, mccain, just to name some). we must count on them to abandon partisan interest and call for a bipartisan joint committee in congress. i would gladly welcome mccain as chairman. he'd do an honest job.<br/><br/>but a congressional committee will not suffice. we need a truly independent prosecutor, somebody who stands above the fray. i'd think of somebody like stephen g. larson, a one-time republican appointee who has argued both ways and stands for the public good. <S_SEP> a bipartisan team of statesmen? surely you jest. name one republican who can even loosely be considered a statesman. <br/><br/>let's skip the bipartisan part and go directly to the special prosecutor part. subpoena powers, arrest authority. dedicated intelligence and law enforcement professionals. no budgetary constraints. fully transparent and public. no interference from the ag and a gag order on the liar-in-chief. <S_SEP> agreed, except that "this matter requires a broader investigation run by a collaborative bipartisan team of statesmen". the two-party system is as much to blame for this fiasco as are president trump and his minions. what we need is a non-partisan team of statesmen, if any still exist. <S_SEP> i agree with most of what's written here, but i disagree with not going after a trump surrogate, because when you have one of them over a barrel facing criminal charges, they will most likely want to cut a deal and spill all the beans, example : john dean during the watergate hearings, buried the president (nixon) and his close circle of friends. both sessions and manafort should be squeezed to find out as much as they know during preliminary hearings. that's how a president is taken down and removed from office. <S_SEP> america, here they are - the two most important words we need to say and believe: "independent prosecutor."<br/>at today's testimony, the majority and minority members brought their own agendas. that's understandable, but not adequate for what we're facing.<br/>say it with me . . . "independent prosecutor." <S_SEP> this administration is a criminal enterprise. it's going to be a profound test of our system to see if it can be fought and overcome. fingers crossed. <S_SEP> special prosecutors have historically disrupted government. is this just one more part of the "resist" movement? those who automatically object to every part of the agenda of the legally elected, without logical analysis, leave themselves open to being ignored when they might have a good point. <S_SEP> well, hopefully trump will step in it one too many times, and there will be a repeat of the nixon fiasco.<br/>better would be that he is charged and impeached; teach a lesson for the future (one would hope)<br/>that said, given the craven slipperiness of the majority of republicans (house in particular) there is no reason to expect a just conclusion to this atrocity.<br/>perhaps when trump starts polling in the mid 20's? <S_SEP> as one very moderate american, my faith in our system of government could only be restored by an open investigation. but the establishment of a special prosecutor seems to have a very thin strand of possibility. watching republicans today made me realize more than ever that they don't have the same feelings as i do about how precious our democracy is.
notwithstanding the hypocrisy at the "news" that russia sought to influence the outcome of the presidential elections, basically standard operating procedure for all nations with the capacity, a hypocrisy akin to a thief pontificating on the virtues of honesty, the nyt fails to mention that both the nsa and the fbi said that there was no evidence to support that the "interference" affected polling results. it also fails to mention that key intelligence officials have not seen any evidence to support "coordination" with the russians. ironically, by arrogating unto itself the option of disclosing ongoing investigations in the "public interest" the fbi wants to have its cake and eat it too. comey needs to be focusing on finding out who unmasked the americans surveilled. he claimed that this was a major concern, but did not even know how many fbi personnel had the ability to do so, unlike the nsa director who gave a specific number. he did not even say that it was something he was likely to investigate. hail comey! <S_SEP> according to the dossier, the russians were willing to interfere in the election on trump's behalf in exchange for a softening of the american stance toward the takeover of crimea and a weakening of u.s. support for nato. trump's behavior during the campaign and thus far in office indicate that he is playing his role to perfection. the dossier lays out a roadmap for the fbi to follow. they just need to continue to verify the information contained therein. comey was sending a message today. the trump folks should all have lawyers on retainer. <S_SEP> comey must be removed from investigating russian theft of the election. appoint a 9-11 style independent commission to investigate instead. why?<br/>comey's boss, jeff sessions, has been compromised by interactions with the russians…while he was one of the most visible supporters of trump's campaign. sessions cannot be trusted and recused himself. so should comey.<br/>then there's trump, the big boss who extended comey's appointment as fbi director. comey relishes his influential position. will he really stand up to the man who kept him in power?<br/>and remember: comey tilted the election from clinton to trump. during july, when clinton led in the polls, comey announced clinton might be subject to an fbi criminal investigation. then he reversed himself. clinton’s numbers never recovered.<br/>comey meddled in the election. are we so naïve that we believe that comey can and will withstand pressure from his masters? that he'll fearlessly examine episodes of russian interference? that he would never discount or hide evidence of trump campaign malfeasance? that he won't meddle again? to paraphrase anthony:<br/> “for comey is an honorable man;<br/> so are they all, all honorable men,...”<br/>comey must step aside on this matter. only an independent commission can be trusted to investigate russia's role in stealing our election. our democracy depends on it. <S_SEP> rex tillerson will not be attending the upcoming nato meeting. instead he is going to russia. now that is in your face balls. i wonder who not only decided this but decided that tonight was the time to announce this policy decision? my guess would be president bannon.<br/>today's acknowledgement of the investigation is just the beginning. that the republicans are fuming over leaks as opposed to russian interference shows the partisan camps that will be functioning going forward. i still am not convinced of mr. comey's independence. while he seemed very earnest, his past actions have shown him to be a republican first and fbi director second.<br/>and even as director, he is lacking in command of his troops (nyc rogue agents).<br/>the trump/bannon counter punch tonight with tillerson's announced itinerary shows a bizarre response to todays events. actually it is kind of frightening.<br/>perhaps it is time for a special independent prosecutor. who knows what trump/bannon will do if they think it appropriate to mess with nato policy.<br/>already the investigation is as you say "muddled, partisan" and it is only going to get nastier as trump/bannon continue to react. <S_SEP> =====<br/><br/>"there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment."<br/><br/>lol!<br/><br/>you don't remember what happened 9 days before the presidential election?! we do!<br/><br/>you also ignore the fact that comey, infamously, did not go public with the russia-trump investigation, which clearly has legs and is a fundamental threat to our democracy, while he, illegally, and contrary to fbi principles, loudly announced his reopening or continuing an investigation of hillary, something that had nothing to it!<br/><br/>by his actions, comey is complicit in trump's victory; by his silence, he is complicit in the russian election-interference efforts. simply put, comey cannot be trusted, no matter what platitudes or claims of open inquiry he makes. <br/><br/>comey, like sessions, needs to recuse himself. at this point, a special counsel with a large staff -- and the resources of the fbi at their disposal (with agents screened out if they had pro-trump leanings) -- is the only option. <br/><br/>======= <S_SEP> comey must be removed from investigating russian theft of the election. appoint a 9-11 style independent commission to investigate instead. why?<br/>comey's boss, jeff sessions, has been compromised by interactions with the russians…while he was one of the most visible supporters of trump's campaign. sessions cannot be trusted and recused himself. so should comey.<br/>then there's trump, the big boss who extended comey's appointment as fbi director. comey relishes his influential position. will he really stand up to the man who kept him in power?<br/>and remember: comey tilted the election from clinton to trump. during july, when clinton led in the polls, comey announced clinton might be subject to an fbi criminal investigation. then he reversed himself. clinton’s numbers never recovered.<br/>comey meddled in the election. are we so naïve that we believe that comey can and will withstand pressure from his masters? that he'll fearlessly examine episodes of russian interference? that he would never discount or hide evidence of trump campaign malfeasance? that he won't meddle again? to paraphrase anthony:<br/> “for comey is an honorable man;<br/> so are they all, all honorable men,...”<br/>comey must step aside on this matter. only an independent commission <S_SEP> is it already too late? trump will be with us for far too long because of comey and the republican smear campaigns.<br/> director comey did so much damage to hillary just prior to the election which may have caused her to lose. people who already did "not trust her" did not vote or voted third party.<br/>director comey did not look at all remorseful for not reporting the fbi review of the russians and possible collusion with the trump campaign.<br/>he should be fired but then what? <S_SEP> i concur that the fbi should be (and appear) non-political. but comey's revelation of the clinton investigation and silence about the russia -trump inquiries remains more than curious. add to that the tip-off about the coming clinton disclosures by giuliani (allegedly based on ny fbi contacts) and the case for political neutrality gets even more tenuous. the ghost of j. edgar hoover would be shocked (shocked!) to learn politics was happening. round up the usual commas. <S_SEP> a couple of weeks ago in a crowded room, president trump blew a kiss to fbi director comey who grinned broadly. comey then walked across the room to trump and they bro hugged. not proof of anything, but telling nonetheless. we all know the fbi intentionally hurt the clinton campaign. does anyone really believe the fbi will conduct a meaningful investigation of the ties the trump family and the trump administration has to russia? i certainly don't.
agree! as a life-long democrat, and one who voted for sanders in the ny primary and, reluctantly, for clinton for president, i have little use for the republican party, its backward-looking policies and its current, vile leadership. that said, the republican party and its leadership are not stupid. the republicans must believe that they would be better off under a pence presidency. it may very well be that the republican party leadership is waiting for some incident or some truly devastating information to come to light that would make impeachment impervious to attack before they take that final step to remove trump from office. <S_SEP> trump has not quite been in office for two months and he is already self-destructing.<br/><br/>there are so many skeletons in his closet, not to mention major embarrassments in his current life and entourage, that he simply cannot govern.<br/><br/>but he will refuse to do the right thing and leave.<br/><br/>i suppose that he will have to be forced out in one way or another.<br/><br/>this is not a matter of dem vs republican.<br/><br/>it is a matter of an ego that is so out of control that he is endangering our nation and the world.<br/><br/>he must go. <S_SEP> i don't understand why the gop is not doing the right thing with djt. the worst that could happen is that he gets removed from office and pence takes over. then the worries really start. <S_SEP> this feels like the democrats' version of the republican's obstruction of obama, only on steroids. <S_SEP> among thousand and thousands of rational people willing to speak for and defend it; among millions and millions who secretly hope for and think it; among billions and billions who long for for it, there is one word and idea that the new york times is too cautious and cowardly and, yes, commercially conservative to acknowledge. let's call it impeachment but the masses and intelligent classes might call it regicide. get rid of trump. no matter what. humanity and millions of species depend on wising up to this utter and absolute necessity. <S_SEP> the republican president and the party he leads have no interest in democracy. their core principles center around power and the personal rewards that it can provide. they have made that crystal clear. <S_SEP> dems are too weak and feckless to fight for their own skins, let alone go after trump.<br/>we are sunk. see you in costa rica <S_SEP> new election......because all of them, being part to one degree or another of<br/>a treasonous event are out.......pence cannot benefit from an illegal and<br/>treasonous act. <S_SEP> the reason for republican complicity with the trump campaign was to ensure that legislative overreach will be unchecked. with every republican stepping into line, this country loses a bit of its heralded principle. this is how it looks when the quislings control.
exactly what part is made up and when and where was it made up? <S_SEP> trump belongs to bannon; they are inextricably entwined. without a doubt, bannon knows where the bodies are buried, who is indebted to whom, and who knew what when. trump can't ever jettison bannon; the alt-right backlash would be devastating.<br/>bannon seeks power through chaos, and the russian connection can only help him gain that power. <S_SEP> follow the money. <S_SEP> follow the money... <S_SEP> follow the money! <S_SEP> i think the russians have the goods on comey too. <S_SEP> , the times, iraq invasion the times helped sell the iraq invasion. they helped give billions of exposure to trump. the continued the hillary e-mail "scandal" well past the date on which it was all debunked.<br/>the times liberal? whatever you're smoking, share it around <S_SEP> as always; just follow the money....
, blair, foreign affairs time for a deep breath.<br/>remember our guys (nsa) were listening in on blair, merkel, etc... anybody recall, that we do the same things? that we change regimes around the world? this is not new. obviously others will try and influence our regime as well. i believe we need to wary of it, but stop acting like we are surprised. this goes on everyday, in business, in politics, etc.<br/><br/>i don't think it serves us well when we go through this dog and pony show with these committees, with the levels of hypocrisy running deep and evident, with the bright lights of cameras and the world watching. they are looking at us and saying, 'aren't these the guys that invaded iraq, afganistan, libya? same guys deploying military to over 700 based worldwide... and they are acting shocked that someone would want to meddle in their affairs'?<br/><br/>is there anyway we can have some more realpolitik reporting by the 'times' vs this incessant politically correct format, that is causing nausea - and feeding the various conspiracy theories, because the mainstream media doesn't accurately report things, with the right context... but some sort of produced/ packaged version of it, fit for hollywood. <S_SEP> "follow the money." still important advice. the obstacle we face is our congress, which sees an opportunity to gut all kinds of government and government-funded programs, from voting rights to clean water protections to birth control access to museum support, while trump gyres and gymbles in the wabe. an investigation into trump and co.'s russia dealings might lessen or put an end to congress's chances to make america a country of paupers and serfs supporting a very few very wealthy. gop members of congress are already tainted, most of them, so they can't stop now. americans must demand a bipartisan investigation, and not let up until we get one. we must demonstrate that we, the people, are stronger than the billionaires and their lapdogs in congress and the trump administration. <S_SEP> , gop, russia and election it is stunning for the world to see the usa go down the path of a banana republic.<br/><br/> i can't imagine any other president screaming fake news on the day that they hold hearings that are supposed to decide if a u.s, president has committed treason or cooperated with a foreign power to influence an election. the populace and the gop would lose their minds.<br/><br/>the complete lack of respect by the potus to any other branch of government continues. treating this like an episode of a trash tv show. instead of possibly the most serious political scandal in american history. <br/><br/>i am afraid the gop left any honor they had at the convention this past summer, right next to their dignity. <S_SEP> please vote america and evict the gop from the state houses and congress. that is the only way we can bring honor and sanity back to america. <S_SEP> "the goal must be to make american political parties and democratic institutions less vulnerable to efforts to distort the electoral process as the russians appear to have carried out."<br/><br/>there should be an *and* there, right?<br/><br/>the goal must also be to put these people in jail who lie and break the laws of this land - just the way we treat the sons and daughters of lower and middle class citizens (and undocumented immigrants)!<br/><br/>i want to hear dem politicians start calling the gop traitors what they are: how dare the gop cover for a man who worked with the russians to undermine our election; how dare they work with and protect a man who named a foreign agent to the head of the nsa ...<br/><br/>gop and those who support them are the enemy within. with flag buttons, of course. <S_SEP> , a special prosecutor, russia and u.s. relations if ever a situation existed which required the appointment of an independent special prosecutor and a bipartisan select committee to hear evidence, the trump-putin scheme has created that situation.<br/><br/>the cover-up and diverting of attention by the white house and by congressional republicans already has begun.<br/><br/>the uber-political congressman trey gowdy of south carolina put on a shameful display of shifting the focus in order to protect donald trump and the russians. there was a time when a politician from the palmetto state would never have dared to be such an unpatriotic weasel.<br/><br/>in recent years, republicans have been rightfully criticized for putting party ahead of country. now, it appears, some republicans are taking their disloyalty to the next level.<br/><br/>republicans are putting the new russian empire ahead of the united states of america. <S_SEP> since january 20th, we've seen congressional republicans choose party over country repeatedly despite the trump administration's bold face lies and strikes against the very foundation of our democracy.<br/><br/>today, we saw a glimmer of hope that perhaps our venerable institutions may stand the test of time. we saw a glimmer of hope that our government may stand the test of time. it was just a glimmer, however, because in order for this investigation to continue, in order for this glimmer of light to stay lit, we need house and senate republicans to do their job. we need them to uphold our constitution, rule of law, and our democracy.<br/><br/>and so far, house and senate republicans have been doing a downright miserable job. horrible. <br/><br/>house and senate republicans - do your job. <S_SEP> that the repubs are objecting to an independent investigation of this is a complete joke. the swamp was to be cleaned in favor of astute businesspeople who knew how to get things done. not one of them would allow “company time” to be spent on an inquiry they felt was not a problem, they’d farm it out and get on with their business. they’d only keep it “in house” if they felt it was a real problem and they wanted to control/direct and spin the outcome. our 8 years and running do nothing congress would rather spend their time and our money on things that get little accomplished except their re-election. “deja vous all over again”.
i agree. sessions is a dry hole. the guy probably said hello to the ambassador, asked where he could get some decent pickled menhaden or blini and that was that. sessions doesn't strike me as the kind of guy you put in the middle of carrying information back and forth. manafort is a different kettle of smoked fish altogether. he could hard wire a deal between putin and trump with a wink and a nod, leave no paper trail, use other people's cell phones, and never send any emails. but, maybe in his haste, he slipped up a time or two. <br/><br/>when you read manaforts dossier you see the breadth of international one on one experience and the shady characters he's worked with. it isn't much of a stretch to see him as the "go to guy" or even the initiator of plans to undermine hillary with with the willing hand of the russians. <br/><br/>now, the russians are not going to out manafort. no upside. he is too valuable for future electoral destabilization planning world wide. the guy is a regular "dark envoy". so, our doj is investigating with one arm tied behind it's back. with deals to offer anyone or people to "flip". and, sadly, under sessions, they will be loath to pursue any leads. so, it falls to congress to push forward with the investigations and the fbi...comey has alreaddy told trump he is not playing ball...and ain't going anywhere. <S_SEP> thank you for taking a strong stand on investigating russian interference in our elections and internal complicity by our own citizens. aiding and abetting a direct attack on our government was once called treason. <br/><br/>kudos to the fbi for at least appearing to treat the putative putin-trump collusion in our election and the continued complicity amongst house and senate republicans as such. certainly many of us think such collusion should be grounds to invalidate the 2016 election and drain the republican swamp. <br/><br/>but the difference in comey's timing between telling congress about hillary clinton's emails (immediately before the election) and trump's collusion with putin (three months after) is more than concerning. <br/><br/>according to comey he was investigating the russian push to get trump elected at least as early as last summer. <br/><br/>if the director of the fbi was more frightened of an out of control billionaire than a logical woman interested in human induced global warming, health care, and russian destabilization of our country, then we are still looking for a champion to fight this episode of domestic terrorism. let's hope comey rises to the occasion. if not, that means an independent prosecutor who includes the director's actions within the scope of his investigations. <S_SEP> for what little it is worth, i disagree that your "fourth" possibility is the weakest. rather, the sort of behavior the dossier profiles is closely aligned with what trump himself has demonstrated. if we can get transcripts of phone calls between trump campaign officials and russian politicians, video-tape evidence in support of the dossier seems within easy reach. and, the existence of such supporting evidence and the power it would exert over a trump administration does a very good job of explaining why the us is becoming a russia apologist. <S_SEP> "as the f.b.i. investigation continues, a series of overlapping congressional inquiries into russian activities to influence the election are advancing in a predictably muddled, partisan way. democrats on the house intelligence committee are working to produce a detailed timeline showing all the reported contacts between people close to the trump campaign and the russian government during the campaign. most republicans want to keep the focus on leaks of classified information.<br/><br/>this matter requires a broader investigation run by a collaborative, bipartisan team of statesmen."<br/><br/>but this editorial talks only about russia, nothing about leaks. yes, this is sure some request for collaboration. <S_SEP> jeff sessions "justice department?" i don't think so. <S_SEP> nick, now it's an irrefutable fact that trump's campaign team contacted not just the russian ambassador mr. kislyak, but also very highly influential top russian intelligence officials.<br/><br/>some of those news will come out on march 20th when the f.b.i. director will be grilled by democratic senators to tell them in one way or another if there were some definitive contacts between trump's team and the russian higher ups.<br/><br/>although it's not obligatory on mr. comey's part to say anything about an ongoing investigation but with the line of questioning that dem. senators are going to needle him with, he has to reply in yes or no terms.<br/><br/> he cannot give an answer like "i cannot divulge any secret information."<br/><br/>and that will be good enough for the democrats to pressure on the republican senators to make the hearings open to the public.<br/><br/>democrats also will force the republicans to appoint a special counsel like archibald cox who was appointed by nixon's attorney general nominee elliot richardson very reluctantly under mounting pressure from the senate democrats in the watergate scandal. <br/><br/>and the 10 points that you mentioned which should be investigated by the special counsel modeled on the line of 9/11 commission, are right on the money.<br/><br/>since there are few americans who think that trump's team did not contact russian intelligence services like g.r.u. and f.s.b. to intervene directly into our electoral process, it's just a matter of time when trump's house of cards will tumble down. <S_SEP> we readers need david to report exactly what evidence there is that russia was involved at all in our election last nov.<br/> one person won and the loser was the sixth to have more votes but in the wrong places, so that seems to tell us any intervention failed.<br/> there was clearly no hacking of election systems or totals. <br/><br/>the u.s. has seen sophisticated e-mail hacking since the 1990's. it makes one look foolish to try to blame all of that on any foreign government. <br/><br/>o, please david. tell us how we know russia did anything, since their partnerships and deals with hillary and podesta were much stronger and more profitable that anything with trump. <S_SEP> the editorial board notes, “before monday’s hearing began, mr. trump issued a remarkable set of tweets calling the possibility of collusion with russia “fake news” and urging congress and the f.b.i. to drop the matter and instead focus on finding who had been leaking information to the press.”<br/><br/>not only was president trump prejudging the outcome of an open congressional hearing, but also suggesting to republicans what they should be focusing on, which they did. all that republican members of the house intelligence committee were interested in was who leaked damaging information about the russia investigation to the press. while such leaks maybe criminal, they do not dispel the underlying basis for the investigation – russian interference in our elections and possible collusion with some republican campaign operatives. republicans can’t wish away the underlying issue, which is a more serious problem than the leaks that have exposed a good part of it. it’s akin to condemning a whistleblower instead of the criminal conduct that the whistleblower has exposed?<br/><br/>it’s pretty apparent from all that we have learned at monday’s hearings that the only way to get to the bottom of this serious breach of our democratic process by a foreign adversary is through “an independent prosecutor, who would not take orders from the administration.” the very future of our democracy and our standing as the leader of the free world could be at stake.
"there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment..." i think there's plenty of reason. comey had both the evidence for trump-russian collusion and the non-issue of hillary's emails on that laptop on his desk, and which did he choose, in the most craven and duplicitous manner, to make an announcement about ten days before the election? comey is extremely compromised and should step away from the investigation and allow someone trustworthy to take over. <S_SEP> , election have we all so quickly forgotten comey's own unprecedented intervention in the election? i'm not so sure that there's no reason to doubt his commitment to an open-minded, independent investigation. <S_SEP> although many of us were encouraged by mr. comey's testimony yesterday in verifying the russian connections to the trump campaign, do we have sufficient confidence that he will remain non partisan.his actions in revealing the investigations into mrs. clinton's e-mails,while secreting the trump campaign affairs prior to the election certainly added to her difficulties in capturing the presidency.<br/>clearly an independent investigation is mandatory.i can imagine that after a grueling cliff hanger that the truth may be obscured and be swept under the rug if the republicans have anything to do with this. <S_SEP> especially after he harped incessantly about the email investigations of clinton. <S_SEP> did you notice comey's waffling when asked about a subpoena for the tax returns? gee, after seven months it is reassuring that deputy dawg is on the case. <S_SEP> "there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment."<br/><br/>hillary clinton. emails. multiple dramatic but substance-free announcements at crucial points in the campaign that unquestionably hurt clinton and helped trump. a sudden brand-new standard for public statements now that trump is in the crosshairs.<br/><br/>mr. comey is an unindicted co-conspirator in this bloodless coup, and the new york times is gaslighting its trusting readers with statements like the above. <S_SEP> "there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment."<br/><br/>what?!?!?!? this is the guy that helped throw the election to trump in the first place! <S_SEP> there is nothing, and i mean absolutely nothing, that this paper could print which would sway me from the conviction that it is without even a molecule of integrity. mr. comey's testimony yesterday was a study in parsing words. he said, for example, that there is no evidence that mr. obama "ordered" surveillance of mr. trump. no kidding. this is but one example of the oddity and dishonesty which saturates these hearings and the subsequent reportage.<br/>ever since this paper printed, day after day, splashed all over the front page, articles and polls and graphs and pictures all of which solidly predicting mr. trump losing in a landslide to hillary, i realized how there is not one molecule of integrity within the pages of tis paper -- or the people that create it.
, ukrainians' death rate, russians' death rate, jd gordon i believe that there was a clear-cut quid pro quo.<br/>politico ran an article yesterday about manafort contact konstantin kilimnik. 'kilimnik, a joint russian-ukrainian citizen who trained in the russian army as a linguist, told operatives in kiev and washington that he met with manafort during an april trip to the united states. and, after a late summer trip to the u.s., kilimnik suggested that he had played a role in gutting a proposed amendment to the republican party platform that would have staked out a more adversarial stance towards russia, according to a kiev operative.'<br/>we now know that it jd gordon who changed the platform and he now says it was trump himself who ordered the change...the only change to the platform that the trump campaign requested. there is video of trump saying that he had nothing to do with the change. why all the denying?<br/>meanwhile, russian diplomats, intelligence operatives, and contacts with the trump campaign have been dying at a rather alarming rate. <S_SEP> softening the rnc position on ukraine (to benefit russia) is a huge red flag.<br/><br/>manafort's career path with russia is a huge red flag.<br/><br/>michael cohen offering a pro-russian ukrainian "peace plan" that involves kompromat and the toppling of poroshenko is a huge red flag.<br/><br/>tillerson installed as secretary of state is a gigantic red flag.<br/><br/>roger stone and his relationship to wiki leaks, and rudy giuliani and the fbi are two disturbing red flags.<br/><br/>red flags are waving, and dots are intentionally not being connected by the republican party. why is that? <S_SEP> , ukraine agression, trump another unconnected dot; why did trump change the gop platform on<br/>russia's ukraine agression and then lie about it?<br/>christopher steele must be interviewed before he disappears again. <S_SEP> i believe that trump arranged to have a pro-russian provision added to the repub. platform at the rep. convention. can't remember the details. no one else on the platform committee wanted it, but their nominee did. it was one of the few trump additions and it looked very odd at the time. <S_SEP> nick, your number 6 is inaccurate:<br/><br/>6. trump has expressed a bewilderingly benign view of russia and appointed officials also friendly to moscow. he did not make an issue of russia’s invasion of ukraine during the campaign.<br/><br/>point of fact, the trump team did make an issue of russia's invasion of ukraine, striking specific language in the republican party platform that referred to sanctions imposed as a result of this invasion. now why would he insist on that detail, while letting everything else in the platform stand as written? <S_SEP> the article doesn't mention another possibility - that a lot of the pro-russia behavior is possibly just smoke &amp; mirrors - an attempt to get around a difficult foe. i don't believe it - but was surprised at bob woodward's comments on sunday that the administration had (according to flynn, what a reliable source!) a 2-track strategy with russia. he seemed to hint that perhaps their public stance in one track, and a second track will be to come down hard on russia w/ respect to arms. ("...there are many unanswered questions about it... two and a half weeks before the inaugural, i met with flynn and went through a number of things, like russia, and he made the case, said, look, we’re going to have a two track strategy, reach out to putin, and at the same time build-up our military in a way that putin is going to hate, and it’s going to be very tough. we have not seen that side of it. but -- so if there’s some strategy in all of this..."). is this malarkey even at all plausible?<br/>i am thinking it is actually more likely that this is the feigned "smoke and mirror" that will be used to hide the real "smoke and mirror." it is unlikely the gop will ever investigate - they're too self-serving and will do all they can to protect their ridiculous administration. more likely they'll hold onto a "ruse" such as what woodward put forward. <S_SEP> aside from the phone calls, meetings, the praise of putin and the ukraine platform change, there's the appointment of rex tillerson, very cozy with the kremlin,as sos. could putin have picked a better person to pursue russia's (read vlad's)best interests? the dismantling of the state department is another troubling event. circumstantial evidence is often dismissed, but it is what wins a huge majority of criminal case. <S_SEP> manafort, close friend of putin, former trump campaign chair, former king-maker in ukraine who also opened ukrainian negotiations for gas deals with exxon whose former ceo is tillerson, trump secretary of state.....this plate of political spaghetti of intertwined intrigue is fascinating....<br/><br/>bannon and the alt-right boys are playing with fire in cozening up to putin for his anti-muslim protect the white culture sentiments, but putin eats people like bannon for breakfast. and then trump for lunch if he doesn't get to destroy nato first.<br/><br/>when we figure this out, trump will have to leave office, though i would like to see his tax returns first.
every morning in france i expect to switch on my tablet and read about a military coup d'état in washington with a non-partisan general declaring martial law pending a new presidential election when the republic's integrity and security are finally confirmed. trump is jeopardizing americans' present and future through environmental vandalism, indifference towards the weak and needy, and ill-advised chumminess with autocratic putin. in other words, a traitor. <S_SEP> trump is a nightmare. the republican party is a group of liars who have no interest in democracy. a special prosecutor is an absolute necessity. but i fear that this will go far beyond anything we can imagine. trump is a danger to the stability and health of american and to peace on planet earth. will the military become involved to save this country from trump and the republicans? <S_SEP> thank you for this. i had completely forgotten about it but recall now how clinton calling him a puppet seemed to hit a nerve. also, how weird is it when trump reflexively seemed to defend putin against suggestions he's a killer, even if trump has to diss his own country in the process? what kind of potus does that? i have many american friends, as well as former classmates and colleagues, so i find all this very distressing and surreal. <S_SEP> sympathizing with "enemies" (borrowing from trump's lexicon) can have unintended consequences. remember the news reels at the end of wwii where the french dragged nazi sympathizers into the streets to mete out punishment, and the startling images of the french women who had been too cozy getting their heads shaved.<br/>who's to say when this is all over and done, that if trump and his group are proven to have been "russian sympathizers" and colluded to help trash hillary and thereby win the presidency, maybe a similar punishment will be appropriate and the donald be shorn of his famous pompadour. if so, poetic justice might include mitt romney doing the shearing. who's to say. who's to say. <S_SEP> , donald trump, election ok, this is the part where donald trump is beginning to look like bette davis in whatever happened to baby jane? <br/><br/>instead of dealing with facts in washington dc, or visiting areas of texas hit by fires and property loss or the flooded areas of the country, donald goes mia and gets his staff to whip up yet another one of his vaudeville/campaign stops in kentucky where he told his flop sweat fairy tales to the faithful about how lifting regs on coal mining and taking away people's healthcare makes america great. <br/><br/>time to come talk to america- under oath this time- about the election, about the wiretapping lies. <S_SEP> i say we send putin presidnet trump with a big bow tied on his neck and suggest they live happily ever after. i'm game, vp pence! what's holding you back? "loyalty" officers? come on, you know how to end around a clown posse, don't you? <S_SEP> one of the keys is the release of trump's tax returns. his refusal to release them signals very strongly that he is hiding something from the american people. that, along with trump's fawning over putin makes a great many people nervous. <S_SEP> i'm astonished that his tax returns haven't been leaked or found by hackers.<br/>ousting him on the basis of his various transgressions, past and present, is not enough: it is unacceptable to have a government (and congress) installed on the basis of deeply flawed elections.<br/>the majority in the us might feel heartened by a cartoon in my (dutch) newspaper of two tv watchers commenting "isn't it exciting, these final days of a presidency?"
bannon and company are in the process of tearing down american democracy, not safeguarding it, and doing a great job. it appears nothing or no one can stop them. a special prosecutor will fall on the deaf ears of the cowardly congressional republicans who choose to ignore the majority of the population. <S_SEP> american values and our unique form of pluralistic government is now in play. <br/><br/>we have elected the equivalent of willie sutton and he is out to rob the bank for himself and his cronies. he has no moral values and no understanding of history or foreign relations. <br/><br/>the world political order has always been very fragile. we can not allow anyone to put this hard fought balance of power in play. trump doesnt appear to give a whit about anything but his own limited self interest. <br/><br/>i would immediately offer henry kissinger a long term contract. we need brains----not narcissism, and rage coupled with a 7 year olds understanding of the world. <S_SEP> i don't get why trump would not want an independent counsel leading this effort. in particular, if he and others in his campaign have done no wrong, as the president has said, they should insist on it.<br/><br/>wait a minute. ok, duh, i get it. <S_SEP> a special prosecutor is needed , and preet bharara would be great for the job. <S_SEP> nixon fired archibald cox. what could keep trump from doing the same? we are entering very murky waters. if trump is to be impeached so the quicker the better. <S_SEP> i got to admit i've never seen a political scandal so obvious, but i am willing to give it the showiest trial trump will love the best because it will be the greatest ever! <S_SEP> obama grew up in a muslim country, his closest advisor, now housemate, is iranian, and hillary's closest advisor, always present, has strong familial ties to the muslim brotherhood. considering that obama/hillary have been deferential to islamists demands here and abroad, confer with cair, and pushed for swarming our country with unvented muslims while shutting the door on persecuted christians, it is these dots, rather than trumps, that must be investigated to unearth what may well be islamist interference in our country. a special prosecutor for obama/hillary along with their capos (lynch, podesta, etc.) is necessary.
re: "democrats on the house intelligence committee are working to produce a detailed timeline showing all the reported contacts between people close to the trump campaign and the russian government during the campaign. most republicans want to keep the focus on leaks of classified information."<br/><br/>doesn't that say it all? "most republican's" response makes it perfectly clear that they're worried that trump and/or his campaign really might be guilty of something awful. something so bad that we the people might insist on replacing trump/pence with clinton/kaine. <br/><br/>test time for democracy in america. we already failed one quiz by installing a president and vice president who lost the popular election by nearly 3,000,000 votes. so we need to get an "a" on this test, and the nyt editors are right that this "requires a broader investigation run by a collaborative, bipartisan team of statesmen." <S_SEP> the american people deserve an 'independent special<br/>committee' to access levels of russian interference in our '2016 presidential election'.<br/><br/>there are just too many house &amp; senate committee members who were part of president trump's election campaign to provide the 'trust' needed for impartial proceedings. <S_SEP> , investigation, russia and fbi, gop i watched the last hour of yesterday's hearings and was struck by two thing. the first, that trey gowdy was making every attempt to make these hearings about anonymous sources and leaks--asking comey questions like he was a 4th grader. the second, that the democrats on the committee, led and co-ordinated by adam schiff, were asking questions that presented at least an idea of the depth and breadth of not only russia's interference but also possible collusion from the trump campaign and administration. if we are to get to the truth, then we must have either a select committee or a special prosecutor. the investigation must be non-partisan and the fbi's work must be supported. if we leave this investigation to committees where the gop can dominate and suppress it, they will. any viewer who watched the hearing yesterday should be able to understand that. <S_SEP> beyond the russia situation, mr. trump is also unrepentantly demonstrating an unprecedented number of business and personal conflicts. it is well past time for an independent committee to peel back the onion and investigate all of it, including his finances. republicans should realize that all of these lingering questions could drag them into a hole so deep, they will never be able to crawl out of it. <S_SEP> , russia and dnc, wikileaks yesterday, a congresswoman from california said she wanted to unravel the "tarantula's web" of complicity between the trump campaign and russia. i thought this was an apt analogy for a witch hunt, tarantulas don't spin webs.<br/><br/>there is no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia. the wikileak revelations were a phishing scheme that the clinton campaign fell for, and revealed nothing but the truth. the dnc is a private organization which is responsible for its own computer security. if they failed to protect their computers that is their fault and not a national security problem. if clinton lost because of it, the american people chose not to vote for her possibly because the dnc disenfranchised all of us by fixing the primaries. there is no one to blame but themselves.<br/><br/>i support an investigation. i do not want foreign countries influencing our elections nor do i want them influencing our government. but, let's not forget the racketeering by the clinton foundation either. there are at least a dozen instances in which our national interests appear to have been compromised by donations to the clinton foundation, it has never been refuted nor investigated. <br/><br/>all i've heard so far is various people in the new administration have done business in russia. all i've heard so far is the dnc was hacked. all i've heard so far is an incoming administration met with a powerful foreign government, which is their job as far as i know. big deal. <S_SEP> the new york times recently blasted donald trump for alleging without providing evidence that the fbi had “wiretapped” the trump campaign, but in his column nicholas kristof provides evidence that the fbi snooping occurred. he provides a link to an october 2016 new york times article that states fbi agents “scrutinized advisers close to donald j. trump, looked for financial connections with russian financial figures.” this is the cyber surveillance that produced the “unexplained communications between a trump organization computer server and russia’s alfa bank.” kristoff seems oblivious that he is backing up trump’s claim or the october article is headlined, “investigating donald trump, f.b.i. sees no clear link to russia.” the fbi determine the dots don't connect. <S_SEP> • mr. comey’s public confirmation ought to mark a turning point in how inquiries into russia’s role in the election should be handled.<br/><br/>no. russia is the easy target; putin, the 'straw man', the whipping boy.<br/><br/>mr. comey’s public confirmation ought to mark a turning point in inquiries into donald j. trump’s and the trump campaign organization's role in colluding with russia to subvert the u.s. election.
i surely don't know the motive(s) of trump's antics with respect to russia. however, given his lengthy ego-centric history, i think it's not likely to take any form more lofty than self-interest and money. those tax returns probably will explain a great deal of trump's strange behavior. <S_SEP> russia is hardly more murderous than saudi arabia in yemen or we were in iraq. i am not a trump supporter at all, but the use of language in regards to russia is as hypocritical as it gets. trump had it right when he said that we are not innocent. as to motives, i think trying to seek an accommodation with a nuclear armed power equal to ours, as opposed to engaging in the same reflexive, cold war anti-russian mentality seems one of the few things that are truly positive about trump and which are long overdue. <S_SEP> "trump merely flirts with the alt-right"--??? he does more than flirt, he installs the alt-right's operators at the highest level of his administration, even anoints them principles on his (our) national security council.<br/>also, for what it may be worth in understanding trump's affinity for russia, i believe he has gotten the majority of his wives from that part of the world. <S_SEP> it's quite possible that there was and is an ambiguous deal between putin and trump, most likely involving money since putin is the world's richest man and trump an avowed admirer - they are the gaston and le fou of international politics. both sides of any such deal are world-class cheaters, though, and they control two of the top three intelligence organizations in the world. i'm afraid we're going to need quite a bit of luck to find good evidence of their collusion. <S_SEP> this is one of the best and clearer descriptions i have read about trump and his ties to russia. what still puzzles me is that the republicans are not interested in the truth. the smell of power is more important to them than the nation. sad. <S_SEP> no one has produced even the slightest bit of evidence that trump has done anything with the russians. however, we all know that hillary sold 20% of the us uranium reserves to russia after a large "donation" was made to the foundation. so who is the one that colluded with the russians? oh right...... <S_SEP> another guess is that trump was flattering putin during the campaign simply because it was an easy one up - hillary failed miserably with putin (personally, putting policy aside). trump likes to one-up, speaks in warp-speed without filters, and didn't mind rubbing that failure in her face. in other words, all talk - which could explain why he keeps saying there isn't really anything there between him and russia. maybe it was just another empty brag. <br/><br/>what really matters is what happens going forward.
trace the money. luke harding's (sr. international correspondent for the guardian and former russian bureau chief's) in-depth investigation to putin's connection to billions in secretive offshore accounts is interesting. i wonder if there might be dots connecting trump or his advisors and colleagues: page, manafort, flynn, tillerson or others to deposits in these accounts. and who benefits from the lifting of sanctions? <S_SEP> , russia and trump, the dossier i believe trump has financial ties and that's why he won't release his tax returns. i don't lightly dismiss the dossier. several people possibly connected to it have been kidnapped or killed in russia. the mi6 ex agent, christopher steele is in hiding for fear of his life. i think this will prove to be credible.<br/>bannon is the biggest danger of all. he believes there is already a war happening with islam and he wants it. he and putin are in the same place on this. <S_SEP> deutsche bank may hold the key. the justice dept. is investigating the bank's ties to russia, money laundering, violation of ukraine/crimea sanctions, and loans to the trump and kushner families.<br/><br/>stay tuned. <S_SEP> we need an independent commission or prosecutor that can decide if all the dots do indeed connect. until then, all we have is a lot of suspicion and a ranting, possibly ill man in the white house who is putting our national security at risk. <S_SEP> there is a wonderful article in this month's vanity fair magazine about trump, his corporations and his dealings with russia. i suggest everyone read it. it sheds some light on some of trump's business deals. <S_SEP> the truth may be a simpler version. don't count out rex, and his allegiance to exxonmobil. through his ability to aid in lifting us sanctions on russia, he may allow for the continuance of a $500 billion oil deal with putin. (that's 29,411,764,705,882 rubles to you and me. . .) <S_SEP> kristof, it really wouldn't be that hard to establish a set of dots connecting obama to having intelligence agencies spy on the trump campaign. that would be an even bigger scandal don't you think?
there's a at least one more, relatively new, dot: cutting 1.3 billion dollars from the coast guard budget while increasing the overall military budget by 10 percent or more than 50 billion. russia is trying to take over the natural resources in the arctic at a time when it has something like a 20-1 advantage in icebreakers and other ships already working to this end. the coast guard is our last line of defense against russia establishing a strategic beach- or icehead at the north pole, which could also have military implications as well. trump drastically reducing the coast guard budget at this crucial time, thereby going easy on another one of putin's endeavors, is yet another dot in the already-well-established pattern of his administration cutting russia considerable slack while continuing to reap the benefits of its election meddling. <S_SEP> another dishonest column from a dishonest paper. the typical democrat tactic is to criminalize policy differences and to paralyze the administration with multiple investigations and leaks. clearly, trump does not want another cold war and sees russia as an ally against islamic terrorism. the trump haters are so desperate that they are willing to plunge this country into another cold war never mind the cost and blood or treasure. of course, it wont be their ivy league bound children who will do the fighting and dying. <S_SEP> this this whole russia thing is like a football team complaining because the other team has a really fast guy they can't catch and, therefore, he shouldn't be allowed to play.<br/>fact: russia will keep it up regardless of what the us does, and regardless of what they say. fact. period. fact.<br/>fact: the only way to do anything about it is to fix our security systems, period. fact. period.<br/>typical liberal (and govt overall) reaction is to blame, blame, blame while offering no solutions. shut up and fix the problem! <S_SEP> the russians don't need to work to erode confidence in the us. government on the part of us citizens. the trump administration has already done a good job of that with lie after lie and lack of transparency. and while using scare tactics about muslims and national security, trump is projecting 14% cuts to the coast guard (which intercepts drug traffic), tsa (11%) which supposedly protects airline passengers, fema (11%) and other government agencies entrusted with national security--all to pay for the wall, while the most porous border is with canada. <S_SEP> putin can now slash the military spending of the russian empire— sorry, of the russian federation. which puppet master needs to waste his money on an army when the 45th potus is in your pocket or you have your hand up inside him? <S_SEP> two competing visions. one the us and russia in constant conflict over who will cause the most damage, exercise the greater global control and will be the most feared. the other russia and the us in partnership agreeing to coordinate efforts to dominate the world together, creating global misery in tandem. <S_SEP> i agree that some people have to focus on the russia/trump axis, but the central focus has to be on trump's day be day destruction of the government's protection of those who most need its help -- including many, many trump voters -- and the environment in which we all live.
once again, the times commentariat don't know the facts. in a july 2016 speech trump facetiously said something to the effect that the russians should release the 30,000 e-mails they'd hacked from hillary's private server she used as secretary of state. this was after it was public that hrc had bleach bitted her server and destroyed the e-mails that were under subpoena by the house. this wasn't a call to hack her server -- that server had already been destroyed. trump was simply riffing on the widely held and reasonable assumption that while hrc might have deleted the e-mails in 2015, it was likely that foreign entities had hacked her server while was sofs and had them. trump was simply saying, release them if you have them, and noted that journalists would likely pay a pretty penny for those e-mails. <br/><br/>period. <S_SEP> , national enquirer headlines, breitbart news, fake news dirty tricks. the russian hacking of podesta's e-mail and the strategic release of those e-mails is just one of the dirty tricks that the trump campaign unleashed on the american electorate. the dark money also fueled fake news, trolls, fox news, breitbart news, national enquirer headlines, james comey announcements, bannon maneuvering, roger stone maneuvering and more. we not only need to expose the tip of the iceberg, but also all of the iceberg that lies below the surface. don't let up until all is exposed and hopefully sanitized when the 2018 voters flip the congress and the impeachment begins. tar and feather all the dirty tricksters and ride them out of town on a rail. truth and decency should and must rule the day. <S_SEP> let's call it trumpgate. encompasses election fraud, hacking, cover-up, perhaps actual treason. i want his name out there, every time this is mentioned. no throwing minions under the bus and attempting to deny any responsibility or even knowledge. rub all their noses in it. <S_SEP> what an empty argument. perhaps they did and found out that she was telling the truth and they were all uninteresting personal e-mails? publishing that would expose their hack, and obviously wouldn't push their agenda. <S_SEP> nicholas kristof forgot to connect one glaring dot: during the campaign, trump encouraged russia to hack hillary's email. this is a blatant admission of guilt. why isn't america taking him at his word? that combined with all of the other dots kristof lists makes a clear case of guilt and perhaps treason. <S_SEP> perhaps not exactly a smoking gun here, but there's more than enough for democrats to bog down the trump administration with headaches in 2018 &amp; 2020.<br/><br/>if republicans can define an email server issue as abject criminality, the chickens will come home to roost. <S_SEP> how did a guy who asked a foreign government to uncover hilary clinton's emails not have instant top grade media scrutiny?<br/>*especially since this wasn't just any foreign government but unfortunately 1 of our biggest adversaries on the world stage?<br/>*especially since this guy was hyper critical of hilary &amp; her emails because they may have contained secrets &amp; now he's asking a foreign government, who just happens to be 1 of our biggest adversaries, to potentially also uncover our state secrets in her emails.<br/>*especially since the bulk of this guys attacks on hilary are because of the supposed cavalier attitude she had regarding secret documents.<br/>*especially since the media was addicted to the hilary email story &amp; now the republican candidate for president was asking about those same addictive hilary emails, and now they also had the added big news of the other candidate for president asking for help from 1 of our biggest adversaries?<br/>*especially since i would say that the majority of conservative voters have a very low opinion of russia so how? why? would they vote for someone who openly asked for the aid of this american adversary? i can't see any other explanation other than the constant drumbeat of hilary hate, hilary hate that has been such a big part of fox-faux news &amp; conservative radio for decades. thank you fox &amp; friends for brainwashing your viewers/listeners into not being able to recognize something that looks like, smells like &amp; tastes like exactly what it is!
david leonhardt's speculations about the russian connection are well put (though i wouldn't so easily dismiss the british intelligence dossier). but i think he's a little off-base when he says that trump went so far as to "equate the united states and vladimir putin's murderous regime." when bill o'reilly reminded him that "putin is a killer," trump replied, "we have a lot of killers. well, you think our country is so innocent?" the response doesn't quite answer o'reilly's imputation of putin's personal culpability, but it does make an unarguable implication about our government's willingness to engage in political assassination and is a useful reminder that we shouldn't be holier-than-thou in criticizing other countries' moral failings. the press only strengthens trump and his supporters' anti-media claims when it overstates or misjudges his blunt, often loose remarks. <S_SEP> mr. lleonhardt's analysis is spot-on win many respects. but the dossier tends to confirm or make more likely the hypothesis that putin deliberately has been aiding trump for many years.<br/><br/>that hypothesis does not require any motive at all on trumps part - that's why i think the most likely explanation is simply that trump is an "unwitting accomplice" and putin views trump (accurately) as being poisonous to america and its values. <S_SEP> oops know he knows nothing about the killing and torture in putins russia. he just like the putin adoration and propaganda <S_SEP> we do not know the full story, but what we do know is that we have an administration without a coherent set of values and principles around which to construct a sensible policy. we have a president who seems to be flippant with facts and unwilling to delve into the complexities of governance and policy making. finally the republican congress does not seem to have many people of courage willing to investigate and understand what is true. coupled with these russian connections, this makes for an alarming situation for america (the administration's first focus) and the world. <S_SEP> "in recent days, trump has tempered his pro-russia comments and even criticized its actions in ukraine. so it would be a mistake to imagine that we know the full story of trump and russia."<br/>no, it would be a mistake to characterize trump's flaccid comments here as him having "tempered his pro-russia comments."<br/>all that's missing here is a huge - or, should i say "yuuuuuge," wink at putin.<br/>i spent 30-plus years in pennsylvania politics. every elected official when he or she "is in the bag," will always assure the company or the lobbyist, or in this case the brutal murdering dictator who is holding that bag:<br/>ignore what i say. watch what i do. <S_SEP> this all makes perfect sense. the media, especially the new york times, needs to keep constant, high pressure and attention on the administration's russian connection. to that end, why not have an article on this issue at the top of the front page every day; as soon as readers land on the nyt's page, it is among the first things they see. <S_SEP> if all of these terrible actions by russia took place, on whose watch did they happen? why, president obama's! you remember him, the guy who mocked mitt romney in 2012 for saying russia was our biggest geopolitical threat. <br/><br/>and that secretary of state, what's-her-name, i guess she was pretty ineffective at "resetting" our relations with russia. <br/><br/>now you lefties are big, bad cold-warriors? now you acknowledge the evil of the russian government? you're laughable, and a bit late.
an independent prosecutor and broader investigation. otherwise, america would not be different from how totalitarian regimes work. there are plenty of countries with regimes that control all 3 branches of government. like the mafia mentality. <br/><br/>trump is an overwhelming boss who does not accept voices that dot not agree with him, much less an investigation of his campaign. it is up to everybody that wants the truth to keep insisting.<br/><br/>the only fake anything is that gop trend of "kill the messenger". i was shocked yesterday when i was listening to the hearings on the radio, i did not catch who was making "questions" to comey in that moment, but the person was making the case that an anonymous source could not be a witness in court. <br/><br/>no, mister whoever, the free press is not the judicial system; responsible journalism researches and uncovers histories that affect most of the people, expose what has to be fixed. in this case, the interference of foreign interests in our presidential elections. there is where our judicial branch kicks in and, get the evidence, witnesses and prove their case if and only if it has independence from the executive branch lead by whoever benefited from russia's interference. <S_SEP> this essay should be required reading for the president and his senior advisers. if the trump campaign is indeed innocent of collusion an independent prosecutor should be welcomed with open arms. however, with today's twitter storm we see trump acting like frightened prey about to be cornered. mr. comey's comments suggest that this may well be the case and that should be disconcerting to trump and his vocal supporters. <S_SEP> an independent special prosecutor is warranted in this situation, and hopefully this special prosecutor will have full subpoena powers to allow the investigation to go wherever it needs to go.<br/><br/>regardless of the outcome of the special prosecutor, trump's base, probably 25% of the electorate, have already decided that this issue, and any issue for that matter, will not deter them from complete, total support for their leader and soothsayer - donald trump. he walks on water to these folks, and nothing, absolutely nothing, will deter them from believing that trump is the best thing since swiss cheese to come into their lives. and this is the scary truth behind the trump presidency. <S_SEP> even if the gop believed in their heart of hearts that there was no collusion during the election they will be very hesitant to allow an independent prosecutor for fear it would become a political witch hunt. you know, like they did with benghazi and the monica lewinski investigations. <S_SEP> this controversy exposes the flaws in our system of checks and balances. the department of justice has jurisdiction over violation of federal law, including any alleged infractions committed by the president or members of his administration. but trump can fire the attorney general and other officials in the department (including the fbi director), compromising their independence.<br/><br/>congress can investigate members of the executive branch without fear of presidential retaliation. but the republicans control both houses, and they have a powerful incentive to defend trump so long as he supports their agenda.<br/><br/>james madison did not foresee these contingencies when he defended the new federal government in "federalist 10" against accusations of its potential for tyranny. this most important framer of the constitution, who did not foresee the rise of political parties, argued that the social and economic diversity of the american elite would prevent the formation of conspiracies that could undermine the independence of the three branches of government.<br/><br/>trump's presidency may provide the acid test of that faith. will the republicans agree to appoint a special prosecutor, or will they insist on keeping the investigation "all in the family"? <S_SEP> yes, actually, i do want a special prosecutor appointed, and i do want the investigation to take at least as long as the "investigations" of both clintons, put together. assuming, of course, this poor excuse for a "leader" isn't impeached by the third week. <S_SEP> , house intelligence committee, russia and u.s. election the leaker in chief appears to be the president. republicans on the house intelligence committee are very concerned about such leaks - called tweets in modern terminology. <br/><br/>representative peter t. king, a new york republican who sits on the intelligence committee. “we always have to be answering questions about the tweets — it puts us on defense all the time when we could be building a case for the president.”<br/><br/>"we could be building a case for the president" does that sound like an objective panelist who want to get to the truth of whether trump colluded with the putin administration to change the outcome of the u.s. presidential election?<br/><br/>way past time for a special prosecutor
now that we have a gutless state department headed by fop - friend of putin - and fellow traveler, rex tillerson, i'm surprised good ol boy rex doesn't show up for his smiley face photo-ops wearing his 2013 communist russia order of friendship medal on his chest ala leonid brezhnev. <S_SEP> complaining here that rex tillerson is skipping a nato meeting but rather meets with russia is low iq. he is just telling europe that they have to prove themselves first before being an equal to the us; basically he gave them fair notice to get of their behind; having observed these europeans at isaf/nato in kabul i can't say he is wrong. constantly drinking alcohol, emailing to mom, and playing volleyball while american soldiers got killed showed the disconnect. high time to fix that. <S_SEP> <br/>there may not have been communists in the state dept<br/><br/>but there sure are kgb agents in the white house <S_SEP> he is a former prosecuting attorney from backwater south carolina and will always be an embarrassment for the usofa! <S_SEP> , ukraine statement in the republican party platform you missed some. the trump team'so role in softening the ukraine statement in the republican party platform. also the appointment of the kremlin well connected tillerson as sec. of state. how many "coincidences" do we need? <S_SEP> it is possible that another dot is steve bannon. he has described himself as a leninist. he says he wants to destroy what he calls "the administrative state;" a singularly un-american term and/or description of our historically successful form of government.<br/>great job, nick. <S_SEP> manafort...wilbur ross...sessions....tillerson...<br/>connect these dots and multiply times 10.....
sounds like you are accusing yourself of lack of reading comprehension. the headlines are vague but the distinctions made in the articles are clear. they are based on the information from sources available at the time. that is why it is news and not news analysis. so your point is?... <S_SEP> and yet supreme leader still tweets fake news. what is going on that facts are ignored <S_SEP> this is an opinion piece, in the opinion section. i worry about people who can't tell the difference between a news story and an opinion piece. <S_SEP> a big problem with "progressive" true believers is that allegations morph into "fact" with no underlying basis. <S_SEP> what is most important factor now is the time factor.<br/><br/>it is essential that before...<br/>- the trump administration obfuscates the issue further to its hapless supporters<br/>- the general public develops a fatigue due to surfeit of information, and<br/>- the republicans abuse "time the healer" to mitigate their iniquity,<br/>the investigation into trump affairs must proceed and conclude posthaste. <S_SEP> absolutely correct, rose. the media are our only hope of getting to the bottom of this. <S_SEP> sorry the news isn't flowing your way. try fox if you want a finder.
what a remarkable change of the political landscape in this country. we went from "the audacity of hope" to "the audacity of lies." how disgraceful will this become? honorable men, in the old days, would have resigned and those in the congress would have focused on the core of the matter rather than the peripheral issues like who leaked the information.<br/><br/>what have we, who have we become? "shame" is not a meaningful word anymore! <S_SEP> , avarice, russia and u.s. government, ambition an independent investigative committee is absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>it seems obvious that the trump administration, with the complicity of attorney general jeff sessions, is intent on weaponizing the department of justice. sessions and his doj minions will be the main line of defense if and when the gop chairs of house and senate "investigative" committees find it necessary to seek out the truth behind the trump-russia connection, trump's loans from deutsche bank, and other likely conflicts of interest, high crimes or misdemeanors.<br/><br/>career professionals in the doj will surely do what justice demands, but sessions and his minions likely will be agents of obstruction and obfuscation.<br/><br/>over two centuries ago, john adams warned american citizens:<br/><br/>"[a]varice, ambition, [or] revenge . . . would break the strongest cords of our constitution as a whale goes through a net."<br/><br/>do any knowledgeable and reflective voters now believe that trump and the majority of his appointees are motivated by anything other than avarice, ambition, or revenge? <S_SEP> funny, i remember all the major news outlets and newspapers reporting on the clinton/lynch meeting, which resulted in the recusal of lynch from any judgments/charges against clinton. what find funny is that you can't see why this is different. sessions himself lied about meeting with russia during the campaign. the gop is refusing to do it's job of investigating the crime, they are instead worried about who is letting people know that there was a crime! what a joke. can you imagine if they had prosecuted the leaker of nixon's criminal actions instead of focusing on the crime? if you can't see the issue here, you are part of the problem. wake up and put country over party. <S_SEP> <br/> the editorial board is absolutely correct. a special prosecutor and/or bipartisan commision are absolutely essential. <br/><br/> otherwise it will take until the dems retake one or both houses of congress. i would also think that if there is something very serious, someone on the lower end of the pole will soon decide to save their own skin. i know i would. <br/><br/>with the recent decision to skip the nato summit and go to russia instead the possible ideas that these people have could lead to a situation where this presidency is worse than our worse nightmare. should that happen, even a person even involved peripherally could be looking at decades in jail. a coup by hacking, is still a coup. <br/><br/> my advice, would be to save your skin while you still can, to any lower end operatives or those who found out but did not participate. <S_SEP> if the end game is trump's removal from office-his narcissism makes it impossible to believe he'd do a nixon and resign in disgrace-the question is what would it take to get the spineless republican party to vote articles of impeachment and then to vote to remove him from office. would profound conflicts of interest demonstrated by his yet to be revealed tax returns do it?<br/>probably not. then what about collusion with russia, putin, oligarchs throughout eastern europe? thus far, but for mccain and possibly graham,<br/>the republicans have consistently and incredible but partisanship over patriotism.<br/>if former mi 6 agent christopher steele, who has now come out of hiding, gets to testify under oath, the odds are that what he has to say, regardless of how damning is hearsay and thus, not particularly probative, if admissible in the first place. impeachement, as we know, is a political more than a legal proceeding.<br/>we are not living in ordinary political times. alternate facts, slaves being equated with immigrants seeking a better life, a former president accused of illegal wire "tapps" (yes, trump misspelled it), dhs considering separating immigrants crossing the border from their kids, a sec. of state doing a marcel marseau[sp], an political aide vowing to deconstruct (destroy?) our imfrastructure...<br/>our republichas never been under such threat sas nice the last civil war-i meant the only civil war. or did i? <S_SEP> well said, nyt. the select committee with subpoena power and a mandate to issue a comprehensive report, as called for by the new york times, is simply the only thing that will permit a credible investigation. mr. sessions has zero credibility in the matter, and there is no fire wall between him and his staff; or between trump and the doj staff. the republican members of congress have turned a shocking blind eye to what's wrong with trump and the people he appointed. at the hearing they showed outrage only for the persons who leaked the information about flynn, and not about flynn's behaviour. what if the information was leaked to protect the us from a terrible collusion that couldn't be revealed any other way? are we to believe that all 9 former and present high level intelligence officials who spoke out were just playing dirty tricks? the republican obsession with the leaks made them all come as moral weaklings; whether they will support an independent investigation will be the test of whether there is any substance in their avowed allegiance to the flag and to justice for all. <S_SEP> as i proceed in age almost beyond my 60's, i often have to readjust my thinking and remember that the majority of those around me were not even alive in 1973, view richard nixon as a figure in american history no more familiar to them than millard fillmore or william mckinlley, and don't have a clue as to what the "watergate" scandal was about or when it occurred or who was involved. <br/><br/>a man with the propensity to lie about anything, a man who does this often, usually cannot even remember half his lies. and a man who lies constantly, and pushes his staff to defend or even amplify those lies, will lie to the wrong person in the wrong circumstance. . .like, oh, say, under oath. or insist that an underling do so, which is subjornation of perjury. that, my millenial friends, is what did in richard nixon.<br/>trump cannot help himself. he thinks that is ok to take "sales hyperbole" and aply it to everything he does. there is a line and he has crossed it. he has crossed it because he does not know any better and refuses to listen or learn. he has no scruples. it's all about what he wants. and if lying makes him feel good, he will and does lie. all the time. he is a dishonest, shabby excuse for a huan being, a role model for no one, and ufit to be president.
the irony in all of this is that we and russia would benefit from better relations. the sticking point in getting better relations was putin's seizure of ukrainian georgian provinces and the resulting sanctions imposed by the west. from the russian perspective, putin warned that if nato pushed its membership to ukraine and georgia, russia would view such expansion as a threat to russian security. true or not, the region is clearly strategic to russia given its location on the black sea and as a buffer to the islamic middle east. in his eyes, it would be akin to the us gulf coast states seceding (ok, i know, let them go ...)<br/><br/>enter trump and the republican clown car. long odds for putin to gain sanctions relief, but probably better than his alternatives. the earlier financial support given trump by the russian oligarchical mobsters was likely just for mutual self aggrandizement. the fact that trump was an earlier candidate and that the brit's portfolio may be real about burning trump only made the option more interesting. once trump actually got his the surprising backing of millions of unhappy middle class americans, putin's interest likely deepened for two reasons: (1) still no better options regarding sanctions and (2) payback for american meddling in ukrainian politics.<br/><br/>so, if you buy into the ten points raised by mr kristof, which i do, you have putin's motive and russia's resources. plus you have trump's fear of exposure. <br/><br/>subpoena the tax returns. <S_SEP> , russia and usa last night it was reported that mr. tillerson was ignoring the upcoming nato meeting and instead heading off to russia to visit putin. no doubt to get some more orders from the guy who's really running our country. <br/><br/>what has trump promised putin? will the us be threatening our former allies in nato with military action if they don't do what putin demands? will putin be getting a delivery of some of our armaments to add to his own? just what has trump promised him? ... i mean, besides promising to hollow out the united states government and leave nato in the lurch ... what has trump promised to give putin next???<br/><br/>i now understand the dour treatment trump showed merkel and the irish pm last week. he was just tolerating their presence till they were ready to reveal themselves fully. he couldn't wait for them to be gone. <br/><br/>i hope the pm of the uk caught that news report about tillerson. trump promised her he would be backing nato and she's been counting on that. unfortunately for her and the rest of the world, trump only tells lies. only in his actions can you see the truth. and in the actions he's ordered tillerson to take, he's told us very clearly that he is in league with putin and that the united states really doesn't matter to him at all, except for whatever monies he and his family can steal from it.<br/><br/>the fbi may need to find concrete evidence before it can charge someone. but the truth of trump's collusion is plain for everybody to see. especially after last night. <S_SEP> , nafta, tpp clarice, yes. all you say is true. <br/><br/>all the worse that we are losing to exporters of oil and hockey players. <br/><br/>we are helping. we are walking away from tpp, nafta, nato. we have lost turkey completely, and most of western europe. trump is following putin: no deals, just brute force and upset of apple carts.<br/><br/>russia grabs what it can. crimea? georgia? chechnya? syria? seems like a pretty successful grab. could anyone entirely about exporting hockey players and oil do that? <br/><br/>i suspect that is what trump wants (to grab what he can, e.g., middle east oil, and scare everyone into obedience). <br/><br/>no i don't want to emulate russia. but my president does. not pushkin's or tchaikovsky's russia. but the brute force using putin's russia. and he is beginning admirably by telling the press to shut up, and calling them the enemy. <br/><br/>was what i was sayin' <S_SEP> well, there might be another explanation: that both are in the pocket of big oil. russia's economy runs on oil and gas and it has now overtaken saudi arabia as the world's number one exporter of crude oil. trump has already demonstrated that he is totally on the side of fossil fuels and against renewable energy. big oil is under threat like never before and no doubt they are buying up politicians left right and centre to defend their interests. this is my concern. trump is so blatantly pro-fossil fuel and overtly hostile towards renewables and the climate change/environmental movement in general. this should be a warning sign to anyone but people seem to struggle to make the connection between that and the russian connection. i'm no conspiracy theorist but it seems very obvious to me that he has been conscripted by big oil. nothing new there, of course, historically most republicans have been very friendly towards this industry but the times, as the song goes, are a-changing and big oil is under threat now like never before. they will stop at nothing to preserve their profit margins and desperate times calls for desperate measures. the plot thickens! <S_SEP> our guy in office and the russians share a policy that<br/>• appeals to anxious people who are worried about their local culture<br/>• defends the oil industry (putin's major study in his college days)<br/>• projects domineering "strength"<br/>• diminishes state support of disadvantaged citizens<br/>• supports the wealthy, regardless of how they became wealthy<br/>• enables the consolidation of business activities and the concentration of wealth such consolidation produces<br/>• supports a meritocracy measured in amassed currency, over all other measurable standards of quality work<br/>• engages in direct, blunt confrontation<br/>• does not tolerate dissent<br/>• treats the role of government as a competition, rather than a means to promote and manage an egalitarian, just society<br/>• really, really aims to make a lot of money, and share it with those worthy supporters<br/><br/>all's fair in love and war....and business.<br/>it's just a game, right? <S_SEP> putin sees hillary as his enemy. as sect'y of state, she endorsed sanctions that prevented him from cashing in on an oil deal with exxon, which is the reason he wanted her defeated, so that those sanctions could be lifted. there would be no conspiracy between the two. <S_SEP> a combination of the last four theories (theory #1 being help with syria is nonsense. trump doesn't care about syria, apart from its importance to putin). given that trump is all about making a buck, and hiding his taxes, i think the financial "conspiracy" is the most likely.
"yet i wouldn’t be surprised if the trump team engaged in secret contacts and surreptitious messages, and had advance knowledge of russia’s efforts to attack the american political process. and that would be a momentous scandal."<br/><br/>more like a momentous crime. <S_SEP> "yet i wouldn’t be surprised if the trump team engaged in secret contacts and surreptitious messages."<br/><br/>if sessions, a top trump surrogate, (i) met with the russian ambassador (and suspected spymaster) while allegations of russian interference in the election dominated headlines (which he did) and (ii) didn't demand that russia stop interfering election, the message heard by russia--in that context--would have been loud and clear: you'll get no complaints from us if you keep this up...<br/><br/>that, mr. kristof, seems to me like a potential surreptitious message--not necessarily a red herring. <S_SEP> but mr. kristof, the so-called contacts between the president's team and russian officials were merely introductions and how-do-you-do type of pleasantries before moving on with their lives, never to interact again with each other again. why can't americans just take the 45th's and the attorney general's word that there have never been any untoward meetings with the russian bear and let it go at that?<br/><br/>the president's libelous attack on former president obama should surprise nobody. that broadside was a red herring to throw attention away from the jeff sessions debacle and suggest that the clean-cut and wholesome 44th president wasn't as innocent or as above scandal and dirty tricks as many people thought. this president is looking for any port in a storm of his own making. <S_SEP> , ukraine affair superb, sober recitation of the troubling swirl of unanswered questions. also important, kristof's appeal to democrats not to descend into conspiracy theories. there doesn't appear to be evidence of the most paranoid theories - that trump is somehow putin's puppet, but there are increasing signs of collusion, if only for mutual convenience. that, in and of itself, would be enough for impeachment, and, if the nation has the stomach for it, treason charges. <S_SEP> the christopher steele dossier was known to the press, and our government, for over six months now, and still no answers. <br/><br/>isn't that really it's own independent outrage? comey was fretting about -- and publicizing -- yet another obsessive review of hrc's emails, but on weiner's computer. but could he be bothered to investigate whether an actual manchurian candidate was going to be installed in office? no. that, somehow, someway, wasn't as important as freaking out about hrc's mundane emails. <br/><br/>and the press too -- podesta thinks he can make creamy risotto!! they were reporting on that, but reports of potential treason.... nope, not a priority. <br/><br/>hillary! emails! hillary! emails! putin has a golden showers tape .... snooze, no one cared. <br/><br/>i really can't get over that. <S_SEP> , russia and trump, russia and usa affair "yet i wouldn’t be surprised if the trump team engaged in secret contacts and surreptitious messages, and had advance knowledge of russia’s efforts to attack the american political process. and that would be a momentous scandal."<br/><br/>true, but the republican congress will try its best to sweep it under the rug. <S_SEP> insider trading.<br/>it's exciting, i bet.<br/>everyone likes to "know a guy."<br/>early on in the campaign, it was closed door stuff.<br/>the inner circle, gathered in a glass paneled room, overlooking manhattan.<br/>"don't worry, mr. trump. i got a guy."<br/>some real james bond stuff, the brothers chuckled, slapping each other on the back as they dispersed to do "the shows." a moment to shine in their father's eyes, in on the game. it was fun.<br/>then it got real.<br/>on july 27th donald talked in an uncharacteristically scripted tone,<br/>calling upon russia to release clinton's "lost emails". it wasn't your typical donald. it was out of nowhere. it was careful.<br/>somewhere, someone who was listening to other traffic, banter between russian agents and someone close, heard something familiar. maybe it was odd the way the intercepted banter and the press conference lined up.<br/>then a counter-intelligence probe began.<br/>it must take a while to untangle the barrage of incoming intelligence, sift through it all. the people who do it for a living, who namelessly toil in windowless offices to keep the nation safe, i assume they are meticulous people.<br/>the answer to your theories, mr. leonhardt, will not just include what mr. trump knew and when, but more importantly, who is willing to fall on their sword for him.<br/>insider trading is exciting.<br/>it's fun to know a guy, until that guy gets caught and sings like a bird.<br/>then, it's important to know a guy who is a really skilled attorney.
coincidence? comey is going down too. remember his bombshell several days before the election about weiner's unproven salacious underage text scandal that never happened?<br/><br/>“in connection with an unrelated case, the fbi has learnt of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation,” wrote james comey, fbi director, in a letter to congress on friday (oct 29). <S_SEP> during the campaign, it looked as if there was some strong pro-trump sentiment within the fbi. how extensive is that sentiment and will it affect any investigations the agency pursues?<br/>it's wise to doubt conspiracy theories, but sometimes they turn out to have basis in truth. who would have thought that donald trump would have been caught on tape talking about grabbing female anatomies? <S_SEP> what's the budget of the fbi? how many agents are there? what a sad government endeavor. how many times do we have to go through this exhausting tale of self justifying busyness? "we're looking into it, we'll get back to you, we have no idea how long it will take, we know stuff but we can't tell you." millions of dollars and endless blather. nothing could stop the cautious comey from shooting his mouth off about the e-mails. inch by inch, slowly comey turned... another confederacy of dunces! <S_SEP> biggest interference was between the fbi and the trump team just before the election when giuliani forecast the "release of something big" during a tv interview. that violation of our election law and comey's "new investigation" was the straw that broke our democracy. <br/><br/>months and years of vilification of hc by republicans and her own inability to express the economic plan of the democrats weighed her down. but all that we have seen since the comey announcement is the consequence of that evil deed. <S_SEP> the fbi? are comey, et al, finally finished looking under every rock for the smoking email and ready to move on? <S_SEP> judging by trump's behavior throughout his campaign, comey's acknowledgment (phone tapping and russian connections) should come as no surprise.<br/>yet there have been so many trump revelations to which the press covers and analyses ad nauseum until the story fades away or is sidetracked by the next trump bomb.<br/>are we really expected to believe that some type of action will be taken this time aound? i just don't know.<br/>perhaps i'm becoming more cynical...or wiser? <S_SEP> we should certainly ensure that the fbi is free to do its work.<br/><br/>that there is an investigation is not itself proof that there is something that will be found. that is presuming guilt from the fact of an investigation.<br/><br/>it is wrong to bootstrap an fbi investigation into a special prosecutor. there is no reason to think the fbi is failing. it is after all investigating, and has been.<br/><br/>why not just go to a special prosecutor? well, because at this level of politics, that has been abused, very consistently. after the clinton fiasco, it was widely said that nobody would ever agree to do that again. well, this would be again.
having friends and allies are per se better than having enemies. so, of course, easing tensions with russia is a good goal. but what will it cost? weakening nato, allowing russia to rebuild the soviet union, becoming a partner in crimes or just a loyal vassal?<br/><br/>trump signaled during the campaign that he admires dictators like putin. he ran a closely held corporation with little internal accountability. his admiration of dictators and his first month's activities reveal a troubling tendency toward dictatorship. <br/><br/>because trump has been secretive about his business relationships, we do not know about ties to russia. until we know, we cannot simply trust trump to be acting in our best interest. <S_SEP> the beauty of this deal from the russian point of view is, even if they only did little and accomplished less, it still gives them ample political blackmail opportunity with which to pressure trump on any issue, at any time. <S_SEP> the fact that the plank in the republican national convention's platform about russia was the only one that trump's campaign insisted be changed, so as to try to very much weaken the u.s.'s strong stance against russia's actions and the u.s.'s impositions of sanctions against russia, is to my mind a huge smoking gun. <S_SEP> set aside your first argument: "fewer tensions with russia would benefit the united states, which is a reasonable position." trump is not interested in benefits to the country, only himself, and he never takes a reasonable position.<br/>lastly, count on republicans to not engage but continue to enjoy this smoke screen, along with all the other trump idiocy, while they continue their nefarious schemes to dismantle social programs, protection of the environment, enriching he wealthy...while opposition groups are distracted by trump craziness like the wall, etc.<br/>those of us who progressives had better watch our flanks. <S_SEP> the final motive mr. leonhardt mentions, an ideological alliance, makes me think trump has been led to believe that by allying bonding himself with mr. putin, the result will be that they will become the two most powerful leaders in the world. in effect, mr. trump believes they will have divided the planet between them. resulting in his ultimate "win". of course, mr. putin understands things differently; he will not stand for sharing much more than a bottle of vodka and a jar of caviar. mr. trump has been handing russia the stability of the united states quite effectively for the past year or so, even more so in the past month. the 20% of that he's spent on the golf course has hastened the process. so long as persistent investigators like serge kovaleski, jake turx and rachel maddow don't back off, and have the unflagging support of their news organizations, the evidence behind mr. trump's motives will be laid bare and america can begin to heal. well, we'll have to deal with president pence first. to prepare, i urge everyone to read "the handmaid's tale" by margaret atwood. <S_SEP> liberal media's obsession with russia and trump is at levels of true mental illness. we live in a world where forming alliances should be encouraged. where was all of this obsession when obama told the russian foreign minister he would have more flexibility after the election? what were his motives? maybe nothing more than alliances are better than hostility. <S_SEP> the article neglects to mention trump's surrogates going out of their way at the republican convention to modify the republican party platform regarding russian sanctions for their conduct in ukraine and crimea. obviously the sanctions are what's most damaging to russia and it'd be top of putin's wish list for us foreign policy changes. however, why would trump's campaign be so motivated to make that change? trump barely had a handle on the basic facts on foreign policy. there was obviously something that motivated trump to order the change be made to the republican party platform.
it took about 26 months from the watergate break-in onjune 17, 1972 to nixon's resignation on august 9, 1974. <br/><br/>these investigations take time.<br/>information oozes out inexorably. <br/><br/>people will get careless and reveal facts.<br/>people in the intelligence community disgruntled with trump will talk to reporters.<br/>insiders will choose patriotism over ideology and turn on the trump movement. <br/><br/>it's early.<br/>but early gets late by and by.<br/>and then trump goes bye bye. <br/><br/>you'll see. <S_SEP> first came the whispers, then came the rumors, then came denials upon accusations...then came investigations and a congressional hearing - and then came a presidential resignation. but that was the 1970's and the watergate scandal.<br/><br/>here in 2017, we've passed the whispers and the rumors, the denials are flowing and there are various investigative arms immersed in their fact finding...<br/><br/>will these 'russia-gate' investigations also lead to, as many would love come to pass, a second presidential resignation? <S_SEP> "follow the money." that's what deep throat told carl bernstein in the watergate debacle. i remember following watergate as a twenty-something during the 1970s. <br/><br/>nixon was forced to resign and it shook the nation, but we recovered. what is so different now is that there is a lack of honorable people in congress, senators and representatives who will put their country first over party.<br/><br/>what is wrong with the american electorate? these people in washington keep getting re-elected. forget gerrymandering! what it's going to take is republicans voting (finally) with their self-interests and kicking the bums out of office. <S_SEP> the truth will come out.<br/>it always does.<br/>this has the feel of watergate circa spring 1973 just after the nixon landslide<br/>and before the start of the watergate hearings.<br/>any thoughts for which trump staffer will be john dean in this era? <S_SEP> i grew up during watergate, and watched the first televised hearings in my senior high school government class. it was a slow drip. took investigators and prosecutors several years to bring nixon down. almost everyone around him had already gone to prison. he denied it right up until the day he resigned in utter disgrace, and was essentially persuaded to leave quietly rather than put the country through a long and torturous constitutional impeachment process. <br/><br/>in the end, even the narcissistic nixon at least put his country first...i doubt this president would do the same. <S_SEP> "people have got to know whether or not their president is a crook."<br/>--richard m. nixon <S_SEP> watch the watergate impeachment hearings on youtube, and you'll see that the strategy employed by the gop yesterday hasn't changed since 1974.
great reporting, mr. kristof! your report here and rachel maddow's tv coverage from last night (3-8-17) provide credible reasons for stepping up the independent investigations into trump's and his associates' activities during at least the last several years! i agree with you that mr. sessions is irrelevant to any future investigations for quite a few reasons.<br/><br/>trump must be forced to show the public his federal income tax returns as all modern presidents have done! it is clear that trump is hiding something! <S_SEP> "any government investigation that doesn’t obtain trump’s tax returns simply isn’t a thorough investigation." why we &amp; the press are so somnolent on the damn taxes is beyond me. the "audit" is 100% irrelevant, yet like some meaty sop to the barking hound, muttering "it's still under audit" silences any questioner for the nonce. <br/><br/>ice raids; #russiagate; tax returns ↠ we need to be honed and vigilant and relentless in our utterly doggèd , even feral pursuit of non-obfuscation, of simple plain truth re these three matters. <S_SEP> i don't think sessions is a red herring. i have read that he was the one who got manafort on the trump campaign. <S_SEP> before the 2020 election a background check, psychiatric check, release of tax returns and getting rid of the archaic electoral college should all be put in place. not the way some of these are now especially that the monster in the wh can just skip releasing his tax returns. we all know that it reveals a mountain of things about him that he is afraid to have put out to the americans. <S_SEP> with all these leaks and clever hackers around, how come no one is able to leak or get at trump's tax returns??? <S_SEP> we need to see his tax returns... dig, dig, dig!<br/><br/>we need to see his tax returns... hack, hack, hack!<br/><br/>we need to see his tax returns! is there no heroic mole within the irs?!?
it would also be useful to follow the money trails of deutsche bank, russia, trump and kushner.<br/><br/>briefly: deutsche has longstanding ties to russia.<br/><br/>where other banks refused to loan money to trump, deutsche stepped in.<br/><br/>deutsche also extended loans to kushner.<br/><br/>did trump and kushner borrow russian money? <S_SEP> yes, kristof is totally missing the money connection. what was going on with the trump hotel in baku, for instance, or with the mansion in florida trump flipped to the russian oligarch? the answers to these and other financial questions are just as likely to bring him down as the political interference issues. plus, there would (should) be jail time for money laundering. <S_SEP> , russian dossier follow the money. donald, jr. could not have known that his father would be president eight years after crowing about ru$$ian money coming into trump organization projects, after american bank$ belatedly wised up to $ix bankruptcie$ and cut him off from more traditional, on the up and up, funding.<br/><br/>and i don't care how much you wish to dismiss the ru$$ian dossier. there is nothing in it that one could objectively say "donald trump could never have done that." <S_SEP> i strongly suspect that people have been convicted of murder on the basis of circumstantial evidence less compelling than what is now being revealed about the trump campaign/administration and the russians. time to start calling for investigations into treason. <S_SEP> my guess based on what we know: trump ran for president without thinking for a minute that he could actually win. his reason is the same for his reason of surrounding himself with russian-ukraine interested people and his love affair with putin. he was constructing a business deal. he was doing everything in his power to leverage all of the free publicity he was gifted with just for running and being outrageous. then when he was beaten he would be well positioned to do the deal with russia and make billions. we were all conned. we fell for it (not me but..) and now we have a totally unfit, conman, who never even wanted the job in the whitehouse. <S_SEP> trump has problems to be sure, and we won't see an investigation by congress unless enough republicans find the courage to defy the dark money that floods every election in the form of conservative think tanks and "social welfare" groups who create attack ads against anyone who doesn't follow orders. the enormous amounts of money flooding the system since citizens united has had extraordinary negative influence in our elections, both local and national, to the point of convincing voters to elect representatives who don't have their interests at heart. i encourage you to read jane mayer's book dark money. be prepared to be very afraid.
a truly independent investigation of possible collusion between russian officials and trump supporters offers the only opportunity to restore confidence in the integrity of government in the usa. there is no other choice. it must be an independent, non-partisan investigation. and, just to be clear, it should be an investigation that is open-ended, meaning allowing for the possibility of collusion even before and beyond the 1996 election campaign. <S_SEP> mr trump said, during the election, that if he lost, it was rigged. it appears that he was telling the truth. we now have a president elect that many view as illegitimate, for good reason, and who has blurred the line between truth and lies. if there is an independent investigation that finds there was indeed collusion between the trump campaign and russia, what happens then? does he still keep the job he did not earn legitimately? <S_SEP> this investigation could possibly lead to the removal of trump from office this year. based on the fact this could be his last year, we should apply the mcconnell rule to gorsuch as applied to merrick garland and suspend confirmation hearings until resolved. <S_SEP> it is imperative that a credible and comprehensive investigation take place as soon as possible. a disconcerting number of republicans have shown, yet again, that they will not support such an investigation, focusing instead on purported leaks regarding the actions of trump's campaign.<br/>trump continues his erratic behavior and bizarre tweeting while packing various government agencies with a hand picked cadre of individuals with questionable motives. the democrats should begin a discussion, as soon as possible, given the gravity of this unprecedented and unpredictable situation, to have trump step aside. a new election should be scheduled for 2018 and all official appointments, including for the supreme court, be put on hold. <S_SEP> impeached for what? the opposing party making up lies that trump colluded with the russians? guess you don't need any evidence to judge someone guilty..... <S_SEP> "any government investigation that doesn’t obtain trump’s tax returns simply isn't a thorough investigation." more to the point, such an investigation wouldn't be legitimate. except as proof that the gop is now in collusion with the soviet sympathizer who heads their party.
really? and why was the russian "ambassador" sitting with all the dems during the joint speech to congress? was he looking for another free dinner? or was it more nefarious than that?<br/><br/>i say he's actually a democrat, and not a russian spy!<br/><br/>if comey stated they noticed cyber attacks coming from russia in july 2015, why didn't they stop them? that part is easy. <S_SEP> the fbi did not investigate dnc's servers (because dnc refused to offer them). how can the fbi and comey say that dnc was hacked by the russian taken their word, and not investigating the dnc servers first? there is a petition started by journalist h.a. goodman on youtube and on <a href="http://counterpropa.com" title="counterpropa.com" target="_blank">counterpropa.com</a> asking the fbi to first investigate dnc's servers. <S_SEP> , fbi, election, clinton emails i'm afraid i agree, especially when you find out that the fbi was investigating trump and his campaign, since last july before the election, but he chose to keep it quiet and instead released information of an investigation on hillary clinton on the emails which was over.<br/><br/>comey's revelations cost hillary the election and keeping his mouth shut on trump's actual investigation that was on going, helped him win the election. <S_SEP> no, he said that whether the interference affected the outcome of the election was not something the fbi would or could investigate, b/c it's not what they do. go back and watch if you think otherwise. <S_SEP> maybe this time it'll get through:<br/>why no mention here (and elsewhere in the paper) about comey's multiple remarks about how nyt (and washington post) got their stories wrong regarding this issue? the same bias that keeps them from reporting this also probably leads them astray on reporting about trump. <S_SEP> considering comey's remit is to investigate russian interference in the election, investigating possible connections between the trump campaign and russia amounts to non-news. <br/><br/>meanwhile, there is not one shred of evidence of russian interference much less collusion with the trump campaign. writing that their are potential criminal charges at the door of the white house is biased political propaganda. given reports of hillary's contacts with the russian you could also say that about her.<br/><br/>by the way the united states has interfered with far more elections than russia - the latest being ukraine where we toppled s corrupt duly elected pro-russian president and replace him with an even more corrupt anti-russian president. seems the major difference between the usa and russia is that we always get caught and the russians don't.
"there is no reason to doubt mr comey's commitment." really? this is a man who had no new information on mrs. clinton yet still opened his mouth which probably caused the election to swing. comey should be in jail for violation of the hatch act and someone else should be investigating trump. <S_SEP> "there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment." am i missing something if i respond to that with, "um...really?" ?<br/><br/>we had glimpses of (a) truth and (b) misdirection tactics in pbs interviews with (a) rep. schiff and (b) sen. grassley. [video: <a href="http://www.pbs.org/video/2365980860" title="http://www.pbs.org/video/2365980860" target="_blank">http://www.pbs.org/video/2365980860</a>. schiff: 07:34. grassley: 18:49.] mr. schiff alluded to the destruction of executive branch credibility. he also noted that leaks that betray sources &amp; methods and expose us to danger are top priority but those that republicans are referring to disclose malfeasance within the administration - and likely originate in the already riven white house as much as anywhere. <br/><br/>meanwhile, mr. grassley said leaks are "of equal importance" with any possible coordination between the trump campaign and the russian interference in the election. he went on: "in regard to the relationship [between the trump campaign and the russian interference] there's a lot of accusations but it was pretty clear today [in the hearing with mr. comey and adm. rogers] it didn't lead to them believing that there was any connection between the trump campaign and the russian government." in other words, at the start of the investigation they haven't reached a conclusion.<br/><br/>asked whether mr. comey's assertion (no evidence that trump's wiretap accusation wasn't a lie) puts the issue to rest, grassley said, "i think that you're going to have to wait until the senate intelligence committee gets done in a couple of weeks." <S_SEP> , russia and nato, ukraine and russia affair i listened for two hours (out of five), and comey had no verifiable news on russia. mostly, he declined to answer questions.<br/><br/>what i did hear: <br/><br/>democrats trying to smear russia as well as their alleged colluders in the trump administration.<br/><br/>republican trying to shame comey into acknowledging that it was the leakers who were the real story.<br/><br/>as for the internal debate -- the ongoing irreconcilability of democrats and republicans -- what can one say but "wake me up when someone switches sides"?<br/><br/>but leave the russians out of the internal debate -- and ditto for the rest of the outside world.<br/><br/>in regards to russia, moreover, the newly enraged democrats and their neoconservative sympathists need to put up or shut up.<br/><br/>nato troops on the border of russia everywhere but ukraine? for what russia allegedly has done (and is doing) in ukraine?<br/><br/>why not just drop nato troops into the donbas region?<br/><br/>i say again: put up or shut up. <S_SEP> i agree with you 100% that a special counsel or an independent prosecutor in the line of archibald cox of watergate fame, must be appointed immediately to mitigate any concerns about conflict of interest between trump administration and the prosecutors.<br/><br/>and who better to work as the special counsel other than mr. rod rosenstein, a career federal prosecutor and the deputy attorney general nominee.<br/><br/>trump, who fell into a deep muck yesterday after the f.b.i. director's testimony before the congress, should not be allowed to get away with treasonous activities before and during his election when he openly invited our sworn enemy to infiltrate our electoral process.<br/><br/>and now instead of giving his blessings to an appropriate investigation being conducted by f.b.i., he's already busy tweeting about catching the messenger or the person who leaked this very important news in this case and alerted all of us about the subversion activities by our cold war time enemy russia, who always wanted to destabilize our country.<br/><br/>and now thanks to trump and his campaign team, russia did change our electoral outcome out of spite for hillary who rightly took the stand in favor of the opposition leader in russia's election in 2011.<br/><br/>but the way trump and his cohorts are acting now as if it's no big deal or quite natural that russia sent their top notch hackers in glen cove,ny and hacked into hillary's email that contained no nefarious activities but very serious campaign strategies &amp; infighting. <S_SEP> comey should be asked what degree of involvement the new york fbi office has in this investigation. giuliani's inside connections to members of that office are well documented; and members' bias against sec. clinton.<br/><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/nyregion/as-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-hints-at-ties-to-the-fbi.html" title="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/nyregion/as-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-hints-at-ties-to-the-fbi.html" target="_blank">https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/04/nyregion/as-trump-ally-rudy-giuliani-...</a><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump" title="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinton-james-comey-donald-trump" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/03/fbi-leaks-hillary-clinto...</a><br/><a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanielmeyersohn/rudy-giuliani-fbi-director-james-comeys-feeling-the-pressure?utm_term=.ohbw1nomr#.vkbx7pdpg" title="https://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanielmeyersohn/rudy-giuliani-fbi-director-james-comeys-feeling-the-pressure?utm_term=.ohbw1nomr#.vkbx7pdpg" target="_blank">https://www.buzzfeed.com/nathanielmeyersohn/rudy-giuliani-fbi-director-j...</a> <S_SEP> devastating testimony from comey and rogers today. also the defiance of some republican congressmen makes a bi-partisan commission with subpoena power and special prosecutor a must. trey gowdy and company want to go looking for leaks, persecuting various victims along the way. maybe they should hireplumber g. gordon liddy!<br/><br/>the game also comes down to subpoening the last ten years of trump tax returns. donald trump was taught by his father, fred trump, and svengali, roy cohn, to stop at nothing to win. the longer investigators wait, the greater the chance of destruction of evidence.<br/><br/>the president's consistent (pathological) lying and his apparent tactic of cover-up really could hurt this inquiry. his next step will probably entail suborning perjury among his family members and aides.<br/><br/>looks more and more like a more dastardly watergate scandal!
was the wikileaks dump intended to draw the cia off the trail of the russia-trump connection/collusion? was it more evidence of collusion?<br/><br/>wasn't that the whole (desperate) point of trump's outrageous saturday morning tweet allegation? the media has focused more on that since then than what really matters, the collusion -- that every day seems more likely to have occurred -- to undermine/dismantle our democratic government's and its international status. <S_SEP> hmmm . . . if wikileaks is good enough to hack the cia, why haven't they hacked the irs for trump's tax returns? i sincerely doubt that the irs has tougher encryption than the cia. <br/><br/>could it possibly be that julian is not an honest broker? and is in cahoots with russian intelligence? who was/is in cahoots with the trump campaign? how 'bout those dots? <S_SEP> , wikileaks, trump wasn't it trump himself who declared that he "loves wikileaks"? wasn't it trump who encouraged russia to hack hillary clinton's emails?<br/><br/>maybe it's time to put trump himself under oath. he will lie, of course, as it is his nature. but doing so in congressional testimony would be grounds for impeachment. this looks like where we are headed, so let's just cut to the chase. <S_SEP> if i were the fbi, i would be looking to turn an insider whether manafort or flynn or others with inside information and then get trump's full tax reports. pull in the cia for international info. trump has gone too far. the gop has gone beyond too far and is too beholding to the mercers et al. and ryan has to go as well. <S_SEP> , wikileaks and trump affair, russia and wikileaks, russia and cia affair so we have a major wikileaks "leak" of explosive materials about the cia just when the trump/russian scandal is beginning to catch fire. since russia seems to have provided the ammo to wikileaks on mrs. clinton could there be a connection to russia on this one too? that would be russia getting materials to wikileaks to save trump from the russian connection to his campaign. you almost can't make this stuff up......this is going to be a major movie sometime in the future. <S_SEP> when are we going to see a full-blown investigation, the imprisonment of suspects on charges of treason, and eventually the execution of those convicted? we need to see some traitors' bodies dangling from a gibbet, or we should tear up our inherited constitution and ask putin to write us a new one.
it seems like trump's tax returns are key to unraveling this mystery. so, can we please have a story detailing:<br/> 1. what an audit of this kind typically entails and what can be learned from it.<br/> 2. how long it typically takes the irs to complete an audit of this nature.<br/> 3. what is the status of the irs audit of trump's taxes. i.e., what stage is the audit in, how close is it to being completed?<br/>4. can the irs expedite the completion of an audit, much as comey expedited the fbi's examination of ms. clinton's emails?<br/> 5. are there legal channels that can be followed to force the release of trump's tax returns? does any congressional committee charged with investigating this affair have the power to demand that the returns be surrendered?<br/> not asking for a big investigative piece here, just a simple story explaining the audit process and the status of this particular audit. also, if someone within the irs were to slip a copy of trump's return into the mail, what issues would reputable news organizations like the nyt consider before publishing? <S_SEP> can the head of the irs at least say that his returns are under audit? trump has lied about everything else, i want it confirmed, at least that his tax returns are really being audited. <S_SEP> as always, follow the money. the answers are all in the tax returns. let us not forget trump's lame excuse during the campaign that his returns were being audited. wow! this is some big league audit....the biggest and longest ever....the greatest....believe me!! <S_SEP> those congressional committee chairmen -- house and senate, all gopers -- who have the power to get trump family inc. federal tax returns from the irs. ... need to be leaned on heavily. it'll only take one or to gop members of those committees to push the chairs to do this. until then -- or until someone leaks the returns -- american will remain in the dark on this. lastly, look up the ubs, credit suisse and other 'offshore tax fraud' cases and stories? the way these work? those "caught" by the irs -- with the help of the state dept. during bush and obama -- had two choices: (1) fight in court and have your names appear in the press, or ( shhhh!) (2) settle -- in private -- and pay your fines, penalties, interest and back taxes. and keep it all hush hush. who here would bet trump never got caught in such a mess? <S_SEP> this story just goes on and on., its like the e-mails that sunk clinton. she could of fixed it by just talking about up front. trump should take a lesson from her playbook, he should address this, and not just by dismissing it. show the people your tax returns, appoint a special prosecutor. the fact he will not do any of these things is because his personality will not allow him to give in or he is guilty. <S_SEP> how can it be that trump's tax returns are more closely guarded than the myriad of other information like the private data of millions of citizens hacked when the opm was broken into? or the information exposed by people like manning? this has puzzled me ever since trump sandbagged his taxes. it's hard to believe it can be kept secret for so long. <br/><br/>i think it's likely known outside irs but used as a hostage in return for favors or money from the trump administration or the republican controlled congress. if that comes out it will be a scandal for the ages.
it's ellsberg all over again, and even the fbi seemed to acknowledge the pubic interest would bear out the inquisition. is the wh trying to say this information needs to be ignored as if none of it ever happened because it is a crime to reveal state secrets? trump's done it enough to satisfy my claim. i'm still sickened flynn was a foreign agent getting access to daily briefings.<br/><br/>i wish we had got to the bottom of ellsburg's case tp establsih this standard in case law, but nixon's prosecutor turned out to be crooked. colson went to jail for obstructing justice. <S_SEP> why is it disturbing or odd that leaks that compromise the national security community and its' methods are of concern, let alone the content of those leaks? and why did the us public need to know anything prior to the results of his investigation, and subsequent resignation? at what point do we recognize that complex and sensitive intelligence gathering efforts should not be publicized until the right time, regardless of their implications? <S_SEP> the odor of hypocrisy rising from the right side of the chamber is overpowering. after the endless hearings to which they subjected the squeaky-clean (at least relatively) obama administration just for the sake of an election-year setup, how this conscience-free gaggle of sociopaths can bear to "try to focus the investigation on the leakers" is beyond me.<br/><br/>if nothing else, it amounts to admitting that they care not a whit whether the trump campaign was guilty or innocent. <S_SEP> , roger stone and carter page, mccaputo, criminal charges against flynn when criminal charges are announced against flynn, michael caputo, roger stone and carter page, the trump administration will melt down like a box of crayons in the hot sun. trump supporters in congress will run away. even president pence may not survive the justice dept. heat. a new deep throat will emerge, one always does. the writer(s) of all the president's men redux will actually have an easier job this time around. <S_SEP> the republican congress will try its best to hamper any serious investigation into the election. not to protect trumb. he's toast and they know it, and want it; the only question is how dark the toaster dial is set for. the look on mike pence's face in photo ops says it all ("i'm gonna be president. president of the united states! golly!").<br/><br/>no, they will fight the investigation because an honest process could invalidate the 2016 election in its entirety, and pence with it.<br/><br/>get those leakers! <S_SEP> based upon the remarks or the lack thereof i wouldn't count on republican "leadership" to properly investigate or hold trump accountable. it will require diligent journalists, leakers and whistle blowers.
not only did the kremlin not think trump would win, trump didn't either. while russia was using its leverage with trump to try to damage clinton, he may well have been setting up business deals (loans?) that would pay off after the election. the voters spoiled the payoff scenario. <S_SEP> going partly with theory 1, trump owes $$ in russia, and the russians are much more demanding of repayment than the us bankruptcy courts with which trump and his hapless contractors are all too familiar. this is how the story began.<br/><br/>and the next chapter, the elephant in the room, is us sanctions against russia. when exxon ceo tillerson, a dual agent also acting as secretary of state, lifts sanctions, a half trillion dollar flood of wealth frozen in 2011 flows to putin as the first massive drop that commences an orgy of arctic drilling. russia's motivation for exerting influence, part of the larger goal of choosing the generally weaker opponent. <br/><br/>follow the $, follow the $$, follow the $$$...... (trump himself always does, can't resist.) <S_SEP> even with potential allies, trump prides himself on playing hardball and engaging in tough negotiation, not sycophantic abasement. but he literally fawns over putin, and ignores "emasculating" provocations by the russian military--very un-trumpian behavior. this leaves only two possible options. <br/><br/>first, that trump really buys into an apocalyptic clash of civilizations and global holy war. russia is the only nation with a sizable military that mirrors trump's view that radical islam is an existential threat. they are the only country that can/will stand with the u.s., and therefore must be appeased at all costs. (putting aside china's similar fights against muslim extremists, or the fact that turkey and iran have done much, much more to fight isis that putin--the archie bunker ethos finds it hard to make common cause with these nations....)<br/><br/>the second, and much more likely scenario, is that trump is fundamentally compromised, e.g., he believes that russia could end his presidency, bankrupt him and his family, and/or send him to jail at will. <br/><br/>(russia's attitude and behavior certainly fits with the second scenario and not the first) <S_SEP> trump owes russian oligarchs one of whom mat be vladimir putin 900 million dollars.<br/><br/>we already know of his business track record and his difficulty meeting his obligations.<br/><br/>it doesn't take a genius to figure out what is going on here. <S_SEP> i prefer choice # 2.<br/>trump "enterprises" have become debt-soaked.<br/>there have been multiple bankruptcies, "chapter elevens" &amp; "settlements".<br/>u.s. &amp; german banks have been "burned" &amp; decline additional loans.<br/>we have not been "privy" to his tax returns, yet.<br/>"russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets", according to mr. trump.<br/>russian $$$ have financed trump "projects" in soho &amp; dubai as well as others. <S_SEP> , arctic deal, russia and trump think about it: trump and his family are businessmen, not interested in government or governing. none of them have ever done anything for the common good, they are only interested in enhancing their brand and making money. i believe their main and sole goal is getting the sanctions lifted so the russians can start cashing in on the deal they signed with exxon (rex tillerson) for the arctic. i'm betting trump, his family, and associates will get their huge cut and then trump won't be interested in governing anymore. mission accomplished!
the russians own him. that's why we won't see his tax returns<br/>unless the senate does its job.<br/> he used the word "i" which is misleading, it's his businesses<br/>that have the loans and obligations<br/> plus he lies about everything. think sweden.<br/> . <S_SEP> imagine this plot on t.v.. a wealthy, " celebrity " nyc real estate developer, out of money and finally not able to find anyone stupid enough to extend him further huuuuuge sums of credit, turns to shady russians for cash. they have plenty of it, and want it laundered, and it invest in the usa.. of course, there are also plenty of brokers, bankers and quasi- government officials, in russia, involved. lots of cash involved, and an endless stream of enormous profit, for everyone. so, they must protect their boy, their frontman, their usa partner. just what can they do???<br/> and this, is just the pilot episode. <S_SEP> its simple:<br/><br/>trump&gt;personal loan $300mm&gt;from deutsche bank personal banker rosemary vrablic&gt;guaranteed by who?&gt;deutsche bank&gt; money laundered 10 billion from russia. <S_SEP> while the motive could be a combination of all the explanations provided here, explanation #2 stands out. as pointed out in detail in other nyt articles, trump burnt his bridges to american banks/lenders, who had been repeatedly made to look like fools by shelling out for trump's bad businesses. of course, without his tax returns (time to subpoena?), we'll never know. <S_SEP> following his fourth bankruptcy, deutsche bank undertook to finance trump when no other lender was willing to do so. deutsche bank was also recently fined $630 million by the justice department for laundering $10 billion of russian oligarch money. trump's projects may have provided a convenient outlet for deutsche bank, in which case trump is beholden to these oligarchs. <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair, money laundering rachel maddow on msnbc had a republican campaign worker telling who-why-how trump people objected to only one platform item: the offer to give ukrsinecwespons to protect its sovereignty from russia-- they got that deleted.<br/><br/>every night she has something based on facts or first person testimony... the fact that a russian billionaires private plane and trumps plane were in same airports at same time. several times during the campaigner in odd places for the russian "fertizer king" like concorde nc.... and trump-russian property sales where the low purchase then high sale price look like money laundering in the millions... etc
the trump team may have sent ambiguous rather than tacit signals to the russians but the russians surely have recordings of those contacts as their insurance policy. <S_SEP> "sessions seems a red herring, in that he wasn’t a secret conduit to the kremlin."<br/><br/>how do you know sessions wasn't a secret conduit? why would he lie about meeting with the russian ambassador? <S_SEP> i am hoping that there is a new "snowden" at the us nsa who is studying the russia-usa transmissions that pass through sweden and are monitored by the swedish fra (defense radio authority) and eventually will find transmissions where trump and co. are engaged in communications not appropriate for a president serving under the mantle of the party that during much of my younger lifetime in the usa saw the soviet union as the greatest menace the world has ever known.<br/><br/>time will tell if a revelation might reveal trump's motives.<br/><br/><a href="http://only-neverinsweden.blogspot.com" title="only-neverinsweden.blogspot.com" target="_blank">only-neverinsweden.blogspot.com</a><br/>dual citizen us se <S_SEP> cia officer aldrich ames and robert hansen both spied against the u.s. for russia. both were successful because the numerous red flags were overlooked, no one believed they would be traitors, but, in hindsight, yes, they were.<br/><br/>today, we are witnessing red flags from paul manafort, trump and two other bit players hiding in the background. but, we are reluctant to believe what we see. by the time counter-intelligence officers convince trump confidant ag jeff sessions it may be far to late with a substantial amount of damage done. <S_SEP> jared kushner's complicity in flynn's lie about no contacts with the russian ambassador when he was present at the meeting in trump tower, his admission only after it was public knowledge that the ci had evidence of it and him not being fired by trump are multiple huge red flags. trump obviously knew and pence most likely did as well. trump probably ordered the meeting just like he ordered the changes in the gop platform that putin wanted and he and his staff lied about. <S_SEP> you forgot to include trump's denials that he had met any russians and then the fact that russia's ambassador was at one of his private speeches as an invited guest and that he had met the man before the speech. <br/><br/>there's smoke and fire. let's see those tax returns.
i feel obligated to state the obvious. where were these demands when loretta lynch was meeting, in private, with bill clinton? if there is little faith in the department of justice, it is because of the long history of partisan abuse of the department by eric holder and lynch. <S_SEP> , senate uh-huh. first and foremost he should refrain from uttering anything against the hearings. what doesn't he want them to discover? hillary survived email and benghazi (ad nauseum) investigations. <S_SEP> mary, go back and read the times analysis of the dnc's response to the hacking. when comey said in the hearing that in retrospect he should have walked over to the dnc and told them himself, he was referring to the fact that the dnc was unresponsive for months to warnings and phone calls. <S_SEP> i am so please to see that the law and justice are in place concerning session. he lie under oath he has lo resigned or fire him . <S_SEP> , trump's tweeting the first order of business is for the committees to block cell phones in the hearings. allowing trump to tweet and have those tweets responded to in real time should not be allowed. if he has something to say, the committee should subpoena him and require him to testify. then all his answers will be on the record and under oath. but then again he prefers to be the snake in the grass. <S_SEP> from the front page "the testimony of mr. comey and that of adm. michael s. rogers, his national security agency counterpart, will most likely enervate and distract mr. trump’s administration for weeks, if not longer..." this says it all. i'm sure many are pleased and satisfied feeling they have trump on the ropes and have a topic with legs. personally i am not looking forward to 4 years of infighting with no progress for the american people.
, russia and ukraine affair, bannon, russian oligarch a more obvious yet even deeper connection to russia everyone in the press as well as ( at least publicly ) the intelligence community seems to be ignoring ;<br/><br/>1)breitbart receivers the majority of its funding from russian oligarch alexander dugin who is for all practical purposes putin's right hand man and who's stated agenda is to create a new euroneofascism to be spread thur out the western world .<br/><br/>2) sessions has been associated with breitbart in his senate campaigns over the last few years , during the trump campaign and continues to be .<br/><br/>3) trump used briebart from the beginning , then hired bannon to head up his campaign and later installed bannon in the whitehouse after becoming potus <br/><br/>4) several other key members of trump's staff have had long term relations with breitbart .. not to mention several key rnc members of congress as well as the senate <br/><br/>so ... dugin + breitbart + bannon + trump = russia . honestly . could the connection be any clearer ? not to mention deeper ? <S_SEP> this seems to be the new party line and came out some yesterday at the hearing. i don't know if it is russian trolling again or right wing trolling by the breitbart/mercer/koch axis of evil.<br/><br/> interesting diversion that has zero to do with trump and his people colluding with russia during the campaign. follow the money and follow the russians. <S_SEP> paula. thanks for that info. shocking that yet another russian connection appears in this pattern that has been clear to so many for over six long months. <S_SEP> , russia and trump trump's ideological link to russia is by bannon who is a player in the alt right universe in which russia is seen as the last great white hope against an increasingly brown world. trump's business link to russia by russian investors in his properties and ventures, and involves manifort and other associates. <S_SEP> i am also deeply troubled by putin's financial support of the european far-right, and what appear to be attempts to meddle in european elections as well. the ideological connections between bannon, sessions and putin -- the bigotry and cultural conservatism -- makes me think these guys would help each other if they could. <S_SEP> you are being far too generous in your assessment and are forgetting bannon's affiliation with the european alt-right, a fascist, 'eurasian' philosophy, and trump's desire to eliminate trade blocks and deal one-on-one with countries, upending the global economy. trump is implementing putin's policy, not what's best for america. while everyone is scrambling around, digging out of a massive web of lies, putin has his fingers on two powerful nuclear arsenals through hi surrogate, trump and no doubt several other fsb operatives in government. i know it sounds crazy. it only makes sense if you look at trump through russian eyes.
the democratic superdelegates serve to prevent someone like donald trump becoming the party's nominee. connect the dots in this cast, too. <S_SEP> at this point any republican appointees should be viewed with suspicion. <S_SEP> but-but-but, there are no "highly respected members from both parties" to name. name one, i can't think of anyone. <S_SEP> this is going to seem off topic some and it is probably going to aggravate in some form the partisan side of things. as the state department is hollowed out there needs to be more individuals who understand the state department taking up positions so they can act to defend it. <br/><br/>it's a shame that there really is not opportunity for condoleezza rice to take. she could run against feinstein however this would only work to replace one good senator. if feinstein does not retire i hope she is able to retain her senate seat. governor of california does not necessarily need to be gavin newson however i do hope him the best in the campaign. i wish there was a place for rice to emerge as i feel she can be a potent force against trump. perhaps if feinstein decides to retire churn would yield to rice. if not however, i'd hope that she could find another position perhaps governor to run for and i hope she would be willing to do so. governor may not be in the position to directly challenge trump's stance on the state department however it could still be powerful considering the size of california.<br/><br/>beyond thus, i hope samantha powers, susan rice both run for senate some where. kerry i would suspect would be done with senate, however perhaps he too can find a position, maybe governor or the head of a university system so to foster future state department workers.<br/><br/>perhaps though a rebuilding will be exactly what the dr. ordered; that said we need experienced people to defend it from trump. <S_SEP> i second the nomination! bharara is free right now and he has gone after both republicans and democrats in the past. he's perfect for the job. <S_SEP> the republican party is now the single worst threat to the survival of the usa as we have known it.
how is comey’s admission that the fbi is investigating what u.s. intelligence agencies “seeded” about trump during the waning days of the obama administration “breathtaking”? if after all the manufactured hoopla the fbi weren’t looking into it they’d have been accused of a corrupt indifference tantamount to j. edgar hoover’s repeated assertions that the mafia didn’t exist.<br/><br/>one might note that the fbi thought public accusations against hrc’s illegal use of a private email server during her time as u.s. secstate also warranted investigation.<br/><br/>no president in his right mind will ever name another independent prosecutor after what happened to bill clinton – forget about richard nixon. for years that prosecutor dredged up every detail of the clintons’ life: a day hardly went by for years that didn’t include news about something that either bill or hillary may have done sometime back in the high jurassic.<br/><br/>what will come of all this is more unsupported innuendo … and nothing else. democrats would be well-advised to just get on with fashioning a workable modus vivendi with trump that salvages as much of what they regard as important as possible. they might start with a list of alternate u.s. supreme court justice candidates for the anticipated retirement of anthony kennedy who, while tolerable to trump in a general constructionist sense, might also side with the four liberal justices on some matters – then figure out what they need to trade trump for the concession. <S_SEP> no matter what one's party affiliation is, when director comey speaks no one can be completely certain of what he says is valid and where things are going. either comey is sincerely befuddled, or erratic in behavior, erring on one side on one occasion, then veering off in another direction on the next. of one thing we can be certain and that is that we can't be sure.<br/><br/>which is too bad. maybe comey is really trying to do the right thing, this time. considering the preposterous allegations being made, hillary's supposed "crimes" pale by comparison. we know trump is a careless oaf, putting foot in mouth before he removes his shoe. but what is being investigated here goes well beyond carelessness, beyond even nixon. what is being alleged are potential violations of the espionage act. <br/><br/>that is serious business, folks. there's trouble in river city, with a capital t. and the probability of it leading to where the buck is supposed to stop, on the president's desk, is great. i wouldn't bet against these odds.<br/><br/>dd<br/>manhattan <S_SEP> special prosecutor, yes;; congressional committee, no. this isn't 1973 and the gop will try to cover up, sad to say. <S_SEP> comey's news was "haunting"? puh-leeeeeeze! the bias in this publication starts with the headline, soaks through the body....and leaks out the end like so much sewage. <br/><br/>i'm not sure which is worse--that the ny times is too biased to recognize its own zealotry--or that the editors know--and just don't care. <br/><br/>this publication is no longer the "paper of record". instead, it has become a champion of progressive causes, and a cheerleader for the democrat party. <S_SEP> with few exceptions, the republicans' performance at the hearing yesterday was horrible and is exhibit 1 why a special prosecutor and a select committee are necessary. <br/><br/>the republicans were hewing to the presidential line of defense: attack the straw man that the russians didn't interfere with election tallies, focus on leaking, suggest that obama could be responsible for the leaks and suggest that clinton had nefarious dealings with the russians. in other words: deny, delay and distract. <br/><br/>perhaps they would do well to remember that nixon was also very disturbed by leaks. nixon formed the plumbers group, in order to plug leaks. the plumbers' best known caper was burglarizing daniel ellsburg's office. <br/><br/>at this stage, i don't fault republicans too much for defending dear leader. trump is still their president and he is supporting the republican domestic agenda. they are, first and foremost, politicians who understand how washington power works. but this partisanship is precisely why a non-partisan special prosecutor is required.<br/><br/>there is a cloud of suspicion swirling around the white house. it will color every foreign decision trump makes. that cloud will not disperse until a thorough and non-partisan investigation is completed.
trump is a puppet. a loud, obnoxious, lying puppet. bannon is behind the curtain pulling the strings. unfortunately, the person we all need to focus on, scrutinize and seriously be concerned is putin. trump is putin's ploy. although trump behaves like a spoiled, rich adolescent, bannon's affinity for manipulation is creepy, putin is sociopathic. all the facts do need to keep coming out, my guess is many of your proposed theories are intertwined. but, the american people need to wake up and smell the fumes and recognize the stench for what it is. 1. it is probable, actually very likely that putin interfered in our election in harmful ways that changed the outcome. 2. it is probable that putin has power over trump...which is interesting because few people can control him. 3. trump may be an obnoxious, egotistical, albeit buffoon, putin is a monster. follow the money... we don't know yet how the final scene of this drama will play out but sure of one thing...it will make watergate seem like "romper room". where do we start? follow the money... not just trump's money... i'd start following the trail of money connected to all the world's oil tycoon's. trump keeps carping on about isis... but it's interesting that saudi arabia -- where isis actually radiates from... is not on his hit list. interesting... follow the money... the dirt will emerge. <S_SEP> "“russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets,” donald trump jr. said in 2008, specifically mentioning projects in soho and dubai."<br/>well, junior's statement certainly puts the lie to daddy's claims last week that he never has had anything to do with russia... <br/><br/>i think that trump loves other 'strongmen' types. his remarks during the campaign made plain that he sees the presidency along the lines of a dictatorship where he would just "fix" or "change" whatever he didn't like with the snap of his fingers. <br/><br/>additionally, trump sees himself as savior. he is in my age group, so the ussr/russia have been the "evil empire" our whole lives. what better for a savior than to be the only president ever (the best, most wonderful) to make friends with russia. <br/><br/>the sad and scary thing is that putin, while he may have a similar view of leadership, and foster's trump's distrust of "the west," can play trump like a cheap fiddle. ditto for folks like bannon. trump is gullible, thin skinned and very, very swayed by personal praise. the clever and sinister, who see this, are truly a danger to us all. <S_SEP> trump is a real estate developer from new york. the money and influence of russian mobsters and oligarchs in new york real estate has been growing since the end of the cold war. what is so confusing? trump's financial entanglements with russian money are obviously profound and resonate with the ways the putin regime is also intertwined with crooked money in that country. where's the confusion? the coinciding ideological are beside the point for trump, i think, although for bannon and the other alt-right crew now ensconced in the white house these may be the most important reasons for an alliance with putin. the most and perhaps only shocking aspect of this entire scenario is the cravenly hypocritical and slavish worship of power from the scions of the republican party that have moved them to abandon all of their former projects in order to serve the trump regime. <S_SEP> mr. trump's campaign attitude to, and declarations about, putin and russia were disquieting. much has been written on the paper trail of money from russian oligarchs and mafia figures going to trump investments. much has also been written about the connections of senior trump officials - manafort, page, and flynn - to russia and their taking money to serve putin's interests. that russia waged an "influence" war against the u.s. in 2016 at putin's instructions is the official conclusion of u.s. and allied intelligence agencies. the president's obsessive attempts to mislead, confuse and spread false allegations speak to his nervousness about the on-going investigations of russian links to his campaign. why is he nervous and what is he hiding? <S_SEP> i'm up to 31 entries in my list of statements and actions by trump &amp; co that directly benefit putin. the bigger my list gets, the less i understand doubts that trump may be a traitor to america. some examples of trump and co helping putin include: undermining america's values, traditions, branches of government, nato, free press, the arts (one of the biggest and most influential american exports), science &amp; health research. also, trump immediately fired all diplomats around the world without replacements ready, cutting security for airports, seaports, coastlines and trains. damaging america's credibility around the world, attacking foreign intelligence partners, defending russian aggression in eastern europe, praising putin and wikileaks, encouraging them to hack clinton’s emails, some people in trump’s inner circle have paid by russia and turkey to assist with propaganda aimed at american. influencing american foreign policy in putin’s favor, hiring billionaires to damage and dismantle essential and quality-of-life services for americans, secret meetings and rendezvous with russian officials and intelligence officers in the cities around the world. with so many clues to possible crimes, common sense suggests that if and when team trump is cleared, trump and his advisors should be suspended. pence should take over temporary duties of the president. i'm not a fan of pence, but at least he seems relatively sane, less destructive and not as likely to start horrific wars.
to all members of congress. you are sworn to defend our nation from enemies foreign and domestic and to uphold the constitution of these united states. it is far past time for you to uphold your oaths and defend our governing institutions as representatives of the people and doggedly pursue the truth about the unprecedented attempt of a hostile foreign power to subvert our constitution and style of governance by election interference and misinformation campaign. this is a far more serious matter than trying to adhere to party loyalty or defending the potus and his administration from criticism. <br/><br/>to have seen republican representatives go after the patriots who have exposed this attack on our nation and not condemn the foreign power who perpetrated this act of war on the people of the united states and those within the current president's campaign team who may have possibly colluded with our enemy is nothing short of an egregious abnegation of your oaths of office. shame on you all. <S_SEP> this is an extraordinary moment in the experiment of american democracy. the oath of office sworn by each elected senator . clearly states...."i do solemnly swear (or affirm) that i will support and defend the constitution of the united states against all enemies, foreign and domestic;..... what will it take for republicans to honor the oath they swore to enforce? <S_SEP> i just thank god that somebody who is not a known bomb thrower is writing about this. when it comes to the possibility that our government is being subverted by a foreign government, this should be talked about all the time. now might be a good time to point out that every member of congress had to take an oath to defend the u.s. constitution from both domestic and foreign powers. why every member of congress is not demanding answers about the russian contacts, the tax returns, trump's unsubstantiated parries, etc - 24 hours a day - is beyond me. this is what they are supposed to do, per their oath of office. we should say to them: defend the constitution or get out of the way. <S_SEP> it must be utterly embarrassing for decent americans (and i know they are the majority in the country) to witness the contempt of their president to everything that is sacred to them. the complicity of the republican party is also humiliating. the greed motivating all of these cannot be further apart from the ideas of freedom and equality of opportunity that underlie the american dream and the american way of life. if americans want to preserve their country and their values, they must wipe off this criminal gang that has taken over the executive power! <S_SEP> , obstruction of investigations the damage is already done. no one believes that there can or will be a "fair and impartial" investigation, or follow up criminal proceedings if warranted. <br/><br/>we have put in power an oligarchy, dedicated solely to ensuring that it maintains power at all costs. consider that richard nixon resigned over less treasonous charges; bill clinton was impeached for less. and yet we have the republican-controlled congress obstructing any and all inquiries into what is essentially an act of war, with the very real possibility of it having been aided and abetted by our president and his minions.<br/><br/>our republic has not seen this level of threat since the civil war.
obviously needs an independent special prosecutor. how about preet bahara? <S_SEP> of course there should be an independent prosecutor with full subpoena power. an innocent president should welcome the opportunity to clear this mess up once and for all. <br/><br/>but that would restore the orderly functioning of government, respect for truth and objective assessment.<br/>it would pin trump and bannon to responsible, fact-based communication with the american people, along with the expiation that transparency about his personal finances would bring.<br/><br/>but it would also eliminate trump's major advantage in governing: a tweeting gadfly, causing chaotic distraction and hourly outrages by lying, rumor-mongering, feuds and score-settling leads the parade--and this is a style he is incapable of changing. <br/><br/>he's simply unequipped to reign in his add, ocd traits that would be a prerequisite to operating in the way the entire world expects political leaders to act. he remains incorrigible and unrepentant--not out of hubris but from the sheer inability to change who he is.<br/><br/>so either way--acting in concert with the russians he's a criminal unfit to be president, or he's the innocent, victim of circumstance and astonishing coincidence due to his compromised mental state, one that allowed flynn, mannaford to manipulate him, and the russians to exploit him--either way he's unfit. <S_SEP> trump is not king. trump is not a dictator. trump is merely president. <br/><br/>the powers of the president do not include lying, cheating, criminal activity and/or coverup. if, as and when he does so, he is a mere mortal, no different than the rest of us. he is subject to investigation, criminal prosecution and impeachment, as warranted. if his obfuscation of the truth, and/or that of his henchmen rise to that occasion, he and they must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. <br/><br/>it's about time for the law to apply to everyone, including but not limited to the president, wall street bankers and big biz magnates, just as it does to the man in the street, and to the rest of us. <br/><br/>and politicians themselves who aid and abet corruption of their brethren should be run out of office by the rest of us the united states. corruption is corruption. no excuses. <S_SEP> america has been in moral fog since the invasion of iraq. the wrongheadedness of that action and the incompetence of the occupation undermined our confidence that we would do the right thing, that we were the force for good in the world. obama represented a chance to regain our footing, but his weaknesses, despite many strengths, and the intransigent opposition of the republicans that haltered him left us in a malaise. that malaise became an ugly rage in the person of trump. he inflamed the hostilities and, more importantly, reduced the respect for truth, civility, and reason. his election has caused a deep breach in our society and violated our moral foundation.<br/>we have few leaders who remind us of what we should be. yesterday, watching the hearing, we saw the worst of political posturing, especially by the republicans. comey, though damaged, and rogers stood out for their honesty. it is clear the dark cloud that hangs over the administration hangs over america. we need to see clearly again and recover our moral confidence. an independent investigator and commission of respected statesmenwould be a first step, followed by a public airing of the findings. that would be a start to a national healing, though i doubt we can make any progress with the current administration and the craven supporters in congress. <S_SEP> can it get anymore farcical - who would have thought american democracy itself under investigation. i mean is this all for real - the american president and key members of his campaign team and cabinet under criminal investigation just mere days into its term. actually, it's not farcical - it's downright scary.
i think it is suprising that there is no howel from the republican side because in the the end they know they are going to benefit from by their draconian budget. they care little about hollowng out the state department or the fda. the republican side has no moral core. look at how spineless pul ryan is. they have no world view. at the end of four years of trump or a hybrid trump pence presidency we will have mess. the super rich are responsible for gutting the republican party because of thier need for conformity. gerrymandering stiffles competitive ideas among repubicans. <S_SEP> it's a coup. and republican, so addicted to accumulating control, will accept the coup. it's also a russian coup that will lead to the deaths of millions of americans when health insurance becomes unaffordable (a lot easier than the old fashion way of invading and slaughtering). and millions of more deaths worldwide will result from trump's alliance with pro global warming, ant-foreign aid interests. thanks brilliant trump supporters. <S_SEP> thank you - please keep up your investigations and analyses- it is simply shocking that republicans in congress still put self interest before the common good of the country. <S_SEP> we need a few good people in the gop to join the dems and defend the constitution. vp pence should broker a deal while we still think he's not a russian puppet. otherwise, this give them ryan! did paul know all the time? i hope congress looks into this, too. <S_SEP> it is difficult to imagine the gop doing well in the next few (meaning decade) of elections following djt. this, just based on the first 45 plus days of this administration.<br/><br/> in 2016 djt did horribly with young white males and educated/ college degreed voters, he is obliterating any support from the immigrant community and once the "uneducated" realize what he has done there will be no more base to appeal to.<br/><br/>add the treasonous ties to russia that the gop has ignored up to this point and there looks to be a massive anti-gop wave about to arrive.<br/><br/>the effects will be long lasting!
mr. leonhardt, you write:<br/><br/>"the fourth explanation is the flimsiest: the idea, contained in a dossier compiled by private investigators, that russia has compromising material on trump. unless real evidence emerges, i’d encourage you to ignore this theory."<br/><br/>mr. leonhardt, i assume that you realize that by phrasing this particular section of your op-ed the way that you did, and not explaining why we should "ignore" this theory, that you are merely piquing everyone's interest in the "flimsiest" explanation? that, or you are working for the russians and trying to throw nyt readers off the track.<br/><br/>you may recall the january 10 press conference at which mr. trump carried on -- protesting too much in my opinion -- about how the dossier to which you refer was "fake news" and assuring us that he was acutely aware of possible surveillance: "be very careful, because in your hotel rooms and no matter where you go you’re going to probably have cameras," he warned. he added of course that he was a "germaphobe" -- that by way of explaining why he would never be in a room where prostitutes were urinating on a bed once slept in by mr. trump's predecessor.<br/><br/>i think that since he delivered those remarks january 10, we have learned a great deal about the idiosyncracies, pathologies and behaviors of our new president. <br/><br/>enough that i would call the explanation above for mr. trump's russophilia the "strongest," rather than the "flimsiest." <S_SEP> haunting, indeed. how are fox news viewers taking it?, i wondered. unwilling to actually see and hear it, i ventured over to their home page. the startling answer is that they're not. <br/><br/>90% of the page is taken up by goresuch stories. then there are a couple of small items about how republicans pursued the real story, which is the leaks from government sources. <br/><br/>the media column asserts that comey has shown no evidence of trump-russia collusion, so there are two equal cases of no evidence: that and the alleged obama wiretaps. covering only one, the media shows its bias again. <br/><br/>bottom line: if you get your news from fox you don't know much, and what you do know isn't true. <S_SEP> "yet i wouldn’t be surprised if the trump team engaged in secret contacts and surreptitious messages, and had advance knowledge of russia’s efforts to attack the american political process. and that would be a momentous scandal."<br/><br/>you've written another dishonest article, mr. kristoff.<br/><br/>it is you who should be truthful: a momentous scandal would be just what you would want, all of which of course would be scandalous only to the left, for whom russia is apparently now the greatest geopolitical threat, the same russia that the left laughed at romney about when he said the exact same thing.<br/><br/>but that isn't the question, though you know that. the question is, was any of that illegal, and the answer is no. private citizens speaking to foreign powers is perfectly legal, unless they are divulging state secrets. and that the dnc (also a private organization) is a bunch of dunces, which is essentially the only thing the supposedly russian hackers unearthed, is not exactly a state secret.<br/><br/>if publishing political truth and informing voters is “interfering with us elections”, and "attacking the american political process", thank you russia! <S_SEP> i agree with your analysis that any investigation should be focused on paul manafort and roger stone. the reason for this is that both were previous business partners and both have a reputation for dirty tricks politics. <br/><br/>it was roger stone who became bent out of all proportion when mr. manafort had to leave the president's campaign in mid august 2016.<br/><br/>it was under mr. manafort's direction when the republican's platform had the words watered down regarding us sending arms to ukrainians to protect themselves v pro-russian separatists. this was the red flag on top of mr. trump's past comments which seemed to downplay the significance russia's invasion.<br/><br/>this was such an anomaly, that this is the time frame that i would want to check out fully. and my antenna was raised when donald trump and his team kept denying any involvement in adjusting the platform's wording when there were credible witnesses saying otherwise.<br/><br/>the christopher steele dossier (which has not been fully authenticated and verified) reports that a russian diplomat operating in the u.s., mikhail kalugin, was relocated back to moscow around august 2016, when it became obvious that paul manafort was undergoing scrutiny. <br/><br/> the mcclatchy publishing company has reported two sources with knowledge of “multi-agency investigations” into kremlin influence on the us elections, have confirmed that mr kalugin was under scrutiny when he departed. <S_SEP> not a shred of evidence related to russia according to clapper. these nonsensical articles in the nyt by rabid partisans are pure garbage and a cover for illegal activities conducted by democrats. kristof has been denigrating trump forever and cannot be trusted to write anything that is not a lie. not a shred of evidence and there never will be because it is all fake news. kristof should have had somebody take him up on his attempt to bribe somebody at the irs to give him trump's taxes, then we could get him arrested for conspiracy to commit a felony. i'd love to see this traitor kristof behind bars.
, fbi investigation, appoint a high court justice stop the nomination process! no president under investigation for possible criminal activity should be allowed to appoint a supreme court justice. this president may have used felonious means to attain his office. the investigation by the fbi and/or independent prosecutor must be completed and the president cleared of wrong doing before such a privilege is granted. any republican that felt it appropriate to hold up a nomination on the basis of an ongoing presidential campaign should also be able to see that any incoming president needs to be legitimate before he/she can appoint a member to the highest court in the land. <S_SEP> the senate should immediately suspend the supreme court nomination hearings until the fbi have concluded their investigation of the potential collusion between the trump administration and the russians. we don't need to be considering a nominee to the supreme court that has been picked by russia. <S_SEP> how can we allow a president, whose team may have worked with an adversarial foreign government to place him in power, choose a member of the supreme court?<br/>how can we allow it when his predecessor, an exemplary president with no scandal attached to his eight years in office, was denied his right to make a supreme court appointment for that same seat?<br/>and who is better equipped to make such an appointment - an extremely competent president with seven years experience or an inexperienced rookie a few weeks into the job, who consistently demonstrates he is not up to the job and not interested in mastering it. <S_SEP> don't forget that the temporary ag from the eastern district of virginia was disqualified from his post by president obama, only to have trump put him back in. rosenstein is his boy. no to any of these tainted ones arranging anything in connection with this. <S_SEP> why does the new york times editorial board say silly things like there should be special, independent prosecutor? we all know perfectly well there's no chance whatsoever that will be allowed to happen.
why is there "no reason to doubt mr. comey's commitment"? he handled everything hillary clinton 180 degrees the other way during the election than he handled donald trump. it's clear who he was intending to benefit. they've been investigating this since july and the american people don't hear about until after the election? and meanwhile how many hillary clinton press conferences did he hold? how many public letters to congress?<br/><br/>this whole thing is despicable. this man, trump, should not be president, that much is clear. <S_SEP> "there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment."<br/><br/>comey good? wait -- i thought it was "comey bad!" hard to keep track. <S_SEP> , russia affair, djt mr. comey again. is he having second thoughts of his hatchet job on hillary and making up in some way? is his boss, that would be donald j trump, happy with his job performance? might his boss, djt, ask /tell him to just lay off the russia thing? might his boss say to hm that his services are no longer required? <br/><br/>could be. i would be worried about my job if i were mr. comey. <S_SEP> "there is no reason to doubt mr. comey’s commitment."<br/>the nytimes explores the true meaning of irony. <S_SEP> comey may have once been an honest broker, but he is not now. now he is corrupted, a creature of the right wing putin supporters, and has a real world record to show exactly where he stands. i have zero faith in his testimony. even his "i cannot comment" is suspect. his actions speaks much louder than the nonsense out of his mouth.
because tillerson is a russian agent and gutting the state department undermines our foreign policy, our reach, and our ability to remain a superpower <S_SEP> there was a "breaking news flash" tonight on msnbc that tillerson has cancelled plans to attend the upcoming nato conference in favor of a visit to russia. why? in the dark recesses of trump's mind, he continues to dig deeper into the chaos of out of control presidency. it has been 60 days and the republicans seem incapable of making rational decisions and continue to defend the indefensible. we seem to be heading for a constitutional crisis comparable to the watergate nixon crisis. "attention must be paid".<br/>trumps use of superlatives has been replaced in my mind with chaos, crisis. irrationality, lying. <S_SEP> another dot...rex tillerson, the great friend of putin yet unknown to trump until after the election has overseen dismissals of long time senior state department professionals yet no deputies have been hired. <S_SEP> so if there was no real there there in the trump russian story why would the trump administration began to distance themselves from manafort and flynn? for a administration that says they are just persecuted by the press this a pretty stupid move even for the gang that can't seem to shoot straight. <br/><br/>truly scary that this bunch of unqualified hangers on, are who we have to trust when dealing with a nuclear armed crazy regime in north korea. <S_SEP> can anyone doubt that trump must resign from office immediately? we are not safe while he is in place, running america as a family business with deep and shadowy ties to russia. he controls our fate at the moment, and that of the world. do you trust him, or tillerson, or sessions? i do not know what we are waiting for, how bad must things get before we begin to demand the obvious: trump must step down to allow an independent investigation to go forward.
kristof is a russian puppet and should be treated as the true fake news author he really is. <S_SEP> what is unprecedented is the coordinated effort to undermine and delegitimize the elected president. kristof is mad because he did not get to see hillary start a new war in syria and ramp up the cold war (or worse) with russia. <S_SEP> thank you, nicholas kristof, for a thoughtful piece explaining why it's so important to have an independent, non-partisan examination of the ties between putin and trump's campaign. i have been having the exact same "house of cards" thoughts for the past couple of months! truth really is stranger than fiction. <S_SEP> and also go to jail along with kristof for his conspiracy. <S_SEP> and without a shred of evidence to support the claims, it is clear that kristof is a fraud and liar. the nyt should never allow these hit jobs to occur because the nyt has zero credibility left.
"the top priority now must be to ensure that the f.b.i.'s investigation ... is shielded from meddling by the trump administration, which has shown a proclivity to lie, mislead and obfuscate with startling audacity."<br/><br/>what a remarkable statement to make about a sitting president. why is this man not being impeached? the nation is shamed before all the world, the democracy is in peril, and the congressional republicans are silent. <br/><br/>furthermore "... it is far from certain that senior officials at the department of justice ... will be able to avoid white house interference." or, i suspect, far from certain that they will not collude in a coverup.<br/><br/>what is going on here? <S_SEP> oh boy will we learn of collusion<br/>though donald is sowing confusion,<br/>his decerebrate flailing<br/>may not prevent jailing<br/>although that's his current illusion. <S_SEP> donald trump has been meddling from the beginning.there should be safeguards, perhaps a special court--if not a special prosecutor--to remove all evidence, if any, out of the grasp of the trump regime. <br/><br/>wapo has suggested that the various department heads have not been able appoint deputies (confirmation hearings have not been taking place, but should by now); but, most have a "special advisor" assigned to keep an eye on the heads. this reminds me of the old "political officers", during the old soviet era. <br/><br/>since his inauguration, donald trump has been trying to block free speech, make the free press irrelevant, and trivialize the lawful right to assembly.<br/><br/><a href="https://thetruthoncommonsense.com" title="https://thetruthoncommonsense.com" target="_blank">https://thetruthoncommonsense.com</a> <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair, trump except that the media has no prosecutorial power. it can't issue summons. and even if they find a smoking gun, if the republican controlled congress decides to do nothing, nothing will get done. trump will skate.<br/><br/>having said that, i think there is a good chance that republicans will move against him for two reasons: 1) the white house will remain in their control with a far more stable mike pence coming off the bench. and 2) they won't say it; but they are just as sick of trump as the rest of us. i don't think, when push comes to shove, "little marco", "lying ted" etc. are going to spend a whole lot of political capital defending him. <S_SEP> the coverup and dodge have already begun. the washington post reports that trump has installed so called political aides in each cabinet. they are essentially spies that report back to trump any disloyalty they observe. installing "minders" throughout his administration is the kind of thing dictators do. trump is preparing for what is about to come. he wants to stay one step ahead of anything that might come out that would hurt him.<br/><br/>ivanka is now setting up an office in the white house. she will be an unpaid, untitled aid. i seriously doubt she will be there to hold daddy's hand. trump is circling the wagons and his daughter is his most trusted and loyal confidant.<br/><br/>the dodge is the constant drumbeat of republicans to investigate those that leaked classified information to the press which exposed this corruption. if it were not for those leaks, this investigation would never have been undertaken. only exposure in the press has pushed it into that daylight. <br/><br/>comey is setting up a dodge by not revealing findings by any date certain. drag it out. another dodge is the false equivalency campaign. the gop is trying to use up the oxygen in the room by investigating our constitutionally protected free press instead of treasonous collusion and corruption that threw a presidential election. the constant talk of no ballots were hacked is another dodge. machines were in fact not hacked. people's minds were hacked which cannot be quantified, but hacked they were.
, election trump inherited a nice fortune and went bankrupt several times. no one in the ny banking and financial community wanted anything to do with him. his father made him several loans for as much as 14 million.<br/>there are plenty of people far wealthier than donald trump, who did not inherit a bundle from their father or got bailed out as well, and did not use his unscrupulous methods to cheat business partners.<br/>tell me this is a really smart guy. without his tax returns we will never really know the true amount of his wealth , or for that a matter debt.<br/>republican won through the concerted funding efforts of the koch brothers who have made their intentions known to influence as many local elections as possible, or do you not read the real news. it was the outdated electoral college which as twice in recent years handed the election to a republicans,<br/>remember, hillary clinton still won the popular. <S_SEP> for such a failure in his chosen profession he sure seems financially successful.<br/>trump will never be obama, he's not a community organizer (code words for agitator). he's a businessman from the pinnacle of american business, nyc.<br/>he made clear his objectives over the past two years. and he was elected as the anti-obama. there is no other explanation. clinton was more obama and the voters not part of one of the victims categories catered to by democrats were so sick of obama's destructive and divisive reign they voted for the anti-obama. <S_SEP> it wasnt a lack of discipline that caused him to declare bankruptcy. it was a business model. the one trick he learned young and served him well. he borrowed enormously against his inherited wealth.. bought every building he could lay his hands on. bought casinos for cash flow to service the wealth. paid off the mob whatever was required. then when the property cycle crashes (which it does every 10 years) he would package all the debt into 4/5 of the properties declare bankruptcy for the llcs which "owned" these companies and then home free with the others plus a huge carry forward of debt. rinse repeat. problem is that his credit rating is poor so he has to deal with increasingly unsavory people to raise money. <br/><br/>the times is playing into trumps hands here too. by conflating illegal and legal immigrants, thinking it is about putins pecadillos rather than mob money, we are left with captain chaos as a cover throwing crumbs out for the media to be distracted from the extreme right wing takeover of our country. <S_SEP> he went to the business school, just as trump did as an undergraduate in wharton's business program. neither man is liberally- or well-educated. <S_SEP> and for trump's republican enablers obviously "virtue has never been as respected as money." --mark twain
the fbi director james comey's frank and bold assertions about the possible collusion between the trump campaign and the russian agents; the forced recusal of the attorney general jeff sessions from the house panel investigations; and the prompt denial of such charges by president trump through his tweets, if all these events are put in a pattern, they certainly confound the mystery surrounding this deadly espionage saga enacted by russia with an active collaboration of the trump campaign team. since the whole matter directly impacts the sanctity and legitimacy of the us constitutional governance as also its national security, it warrants a thorough independent investigation in larger public interest.at the same time, the bottom up public pressure on the capitol hill to that effect too might work as the requisite democratic check against the possible white house cover up. <S_SEP> i could not agree more and i have been waiting for someone to say "hey, wait a minute, don't we have unfinished business with mr. comey"... oy vey.<br/>we absolutely need an independent special prosecutor assigned to take over this investigation. <S_SEP> how come comey is still involved in election related issues?<br/><br/>had he not cast doubt about hilary's mail use then she probably would have won the election. apparently during that same time he threw hilary under the bus comey knew that there were potential issues involving trump.<br/><br/>we need a special nonpartisan prosecutor to carry out this important case. <S_SEP> drama, drama,....!<br/>mr. comey, as well as the fbi, is embarked on a dangerous journey. quite likely heads will roll, whos is the question??????<br/>i personally think that mr. comey's objective is to force the congress to take action(s). however, i don't believe that the house is going to repond without a real smoking gun! <S_SEP> first paragraph of article: <br/><br/>"the acknowledgment by james comey, the f.b.i. director, on monday that the bureau is investigating possible connections between president trump’s campaign and russia’s efforts to sabotage hillary clinton’s chances is a breathtaking admission" (breathtaking admission of what other than an investigation?). <br/><br/>continuing with first paragraph of article: <br/><br/>"while there has been a growing body of circumstantial evidence of such links, mr. comey’s public confirmation..." (confirmation of what other than possible links? the article reads as if to suggest comey confirmed there are links) "ought to mark a turning point in how inquiries into russia’s role in the election should be handled."<br/><br/>i would suggest democrats be extremely careful how they proceed. it sounds like language games are being played already. so far as i can tell the f.b.i. is examining possible links, but it sounds like the democrats are turning the investigation of possible links into proof that such links already exist. so far as i can tell little bipartisan effort seems to be forthcoming with so much nastiness from both political parties with respect to this problem.
"these brazen warning shots from the president do enormous damage to public confidence in the f.b.i.’s investigation." trump has or should have the problem of "public confidence." <br/><br/>the fbi is doing what it should do. there is ample reason to investigation the "russian nexus" -- more than enough to preclude any "witch hunt" type allegation.<br/><br/>the congress is doing what it should do -- i.e. joint statements from the republican and democratic leaders of both intelligence committees debunking trump's outrageous wiretapping allegations. <S_SEP> regarding the last sentence of this piece, it is more than likely that it will be up to the press and leakers to seek the truth - given that official investigations depend on congressional republicans, sessions and comey. i have no faith in any of them. <S_SEP> a day of reckoning for president trump and his administration may be at hand. the fbi will not have to dig too deeply. chances are, they probable already have damaging intelligence linking the administration and trump to russian ties. this president and his administration have made a mockery of the oval office, american democracy and have abandoned the values of the american people.<br/><br/>president trump continues to tweet non factual accusations and remarks but this is truly a sign of someone who is afraid and insecure. the bubble of deception will eventually burst and show his true colors....and they won't be red white and blue. <S_SEP> we have a lot of dots to connect, but i believe it will be possible if allowed to be investigated by independent non-partisan counsel. what i find disturbing is the alarmingly high mortality rates for russians who have been connected trump. i am not pointing fingers at trump, seems something vlad would not have a second thought about. but the trump administration is trying desperately hard to sweep it under the rug, but dead bodies, and a dossier that is being corroborated every day, will be impossible to sweep under the rug. honest persons have nothing to hide. <S_SEP> manafort, flynn, tillerson, then a quote from joint cia, fbi and nsa report: "putin and the russian government aspired to help president-elect trump's election chances when possible by discrediting secretary clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him. all three agencies agree with this judgment." (<a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ica_2017_01.pdf" title="https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ica_2017_01.pdf" target="_blank">https://www.dni.gov/files/documents/ica_2017_01.pdf</a> )<br/>there's so much smoke coming out trump-putin connections, that russia's embarrassing aircraft carrier admiral kuznetsov pales against it.
, russian businesses, russian money as you say, mr. leonhardt, your five possibilities are not mutually exclusive. but let's focus on the one most likely to be true--namely, the second possibility of a business conspiracy. if one reads about trump's history, you learn that he has been involved with russia in some capacity at least since the 1990s. given that long-term involvement it is not surprising that so many of his current advisers and hangers-on have connections to russia: michael cohen, flynn, manafort, carter page, boris epshteyn, roger stone, felix sater (just to name a few off the top of my head). a lot of shady characters there, and all with strong connections to russia.<br/><br/>so: 3 decades of involvement in russia, a whole team of russian-related advisers, but we are to believe trump that he has absolutely no business interests in, or more importantly no indebtedness to russia? all that time spent and the only concrete result was a beauty contest in 2013? come on-- even in the world of trump that strains credulity. <br/><br/>my rule of thumb with trump is that the reality of his actions are generally<br/>way worse than the appearance. rumors are now flying about massive debt to russian mobsters and the possibility that his "businesses" have long been fronts for dirty russian money. if my rule of thumb is at all correct we are in for some shocking revelations. <S_SEP> reading this piece was a waste of two valuable minutes that i will never get back. summary: author has absolutely no idea what trump is thinking or doing with regards to u.s relationship with russia. the end. <S_SEP> this is a dangerous, but a very educational time. we have an agent of a foreign government in our white house, supported by gutless congressional republicans who seem to see their greatest task to take from the poor and give to the rich.<br/>slowly, terribly slowly in my view, americans are understanding the evil that trump represents. he isn't just a clown, or another far right figure, he is in fact working to destabilize america, pull down american institutions, and force the poor to fight for every scrap. that isn't to make america greater, it is to make putin the world's puppet master. we need to get the traitor trump out of his office, his gilded tower, and we need to put him and those who allied with him and putin on a plane to moscow.<br/>hugh massengill, eugene oregon <S_SEP> i would love to pin collusion with the russians on trump. i would pin a tale on the donkey if it would eliminate him from the current scene.<br/>i do not expect that whatever transpired between foreign interests and trump will amount to enough to force president chaos out of circulation. <S_SEP> i think there is a much more simple explanation for trump's ties to russia. he agreed to lift the sanctions in exchange for a piece of the pie when it came to the deal with exxon.<br/><br/>what proof do i have? absolutely none, but it is much more plausible given his bizarre and self-destructive behavior about the russian connection. trump probably doesn't think that chatting with a foreign egovernment about an american election is illegal, and, i highly doubt he think the american public would care about it if it was. he is probably correct about that when it comes to his supporters, in fact.<br/><br/>however, taking money from a foreign government in exchange for lifting sanctions is treason. it is obvious treason, and even he knows it is treason. he wouldn't just face a scandal were it to come out, something that he seems quite happy to do on a regular basis. he would face serious jail time.<br/><br/>that is the only explanation that i think explains his behavior on this issue. time will tell.
simple solution to put the allegation to rest. mr. trump instigates a full blown investigation by our intelligence agencies to get to the bottom of what was done by the russians during the election using the full weight of his presidency to prod the appropriate parties. if our election was tampered with by a foreign government the citizens should know the extent and measures to prevent it in the future. why hasn't he done that ? his actions are not logical. what is his issue with this important problem ? <S_SEP> keep digging investigative reporters of the press and particularly new york times. this parasite who is president is owned by the russians and he is fully compromised. keep asking spicer daily and trump when you get the chance about the establishment of an independent investigation. keep the heat on these corrupt individuals. guaranteed they are guilty as sin. <S_SEP> no, the mystery at the core of the trump / russia story is what, exactly, russia is accused of doing to "interfere" in the us election. the times never says -- beyond the vague accusation. did they do the dnc hacking that revealed the shenanigans against a bernie sanders? if so, they did a better job than us election officials. did they hack hillary's and john podesta's emails? then they performed a public service where the us dept of justice was asleep at the wheel. i didn't vote for mr. trump (or hillary), but the russia hysteria promoted in this newspaper is disgraceful. <S_SEP> trump's invitation to russia to hack his opponent in our election, should never have been taken by anyone as a joke. he should have been investigated and interviewed at that very moment. if he was suspected of treason, then fine-- try, convict and punish him. at the very least the gop should have reined in or fired him right then. but wait-- they knew he was the only candidate who had a chance of beating hrc, so they let it roll. and here we are, in a crisis of magnitude. <S_SEP> it is clear that an independent investigation is needed to get to the bottom of all these "coincidences." trump is a master of dirty dealing and this is the ultimate dirty deal. if these contacts are found to be non-treasonous, we can move on. if not, we need to call for a new election. while pence may have been in the dark on all this, the campaign as a whole benefited from the russian efforts. a pence presidency should not be the result of this investigation.
trump has only recently "tempered" his pro-russian comments recently in an attempt to deflect attention and opinion away from this scandal. he's in it with putin up to his orange tinged eyeballs. the information is out there and the wheels are in motion. he will be impeached over this. they're letting it play out slowly to soften the blow, but the hit is coming. <S_SEP> this is extremely serious stuff.<br/><br/>i still doubt there will ever be any proven collusion. these things are very, very hard to prove without someone inside spilling the beans. one issue is that even without proof, if it looks like you colluded with russia to win the election, you have very little legitimacy. the u.s. doesn't need a lame duck president with four years to go. ugh. <S_SEP> "the fourth explanation is the flimsiest: the idea, contained in a dossier compiled by private investigators, that russia has compromising material on trump. unless real evidence emerges, i’d encourage you to ignore this theory."<br/><br/>why? because it's distasteful to you? given this man's propensity for lying - and i wish journalists would stop using weak words like "misspeak" or "misstatement." trump and his white house lie on a regular basis - he deserves no benefit of the doubt on this or any other area. <S_SEP> the appearance is that trump is still colluding with the russians. the idiot knows this will end badly for him and the fbi must bring charges asap before he starts a fight with his new found strength - the us military. <S_SEP> if there wasn't something to the russia questions, trump wouldn't be throwing up smokescreens. he's trying to discredit, in advance, any investigation that takes place. he's panicked. if he hadn't lied about so much before, during and after the election his denials might have more credence now. but, it's too late, he's lost all credibility, and we know that whatever he says, the opposite is probably true. which means, there's definitely something to all the russia accusations.
donald openly invited the russians in july 2016 to break into hillary's emails. how can he or his administration not be held accountable, he certainly doesn't have a legal leg to stand on for inquiry, since he oked it&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; <S_SEP> what we have in the trump administration is the syndrome of "blame the messenger" of truth as a smokescreen for what truth might be revealed. if roger stone could gleefully predict befire the fact that john podesta's emails would be made public by tha putin-assange alliance, then there has to have existed prior collusion. such clairvoyance on stone's part did not result from a flash of insight on the road to damascus. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.endthemadnessnow.org" title="www.endthemadnessnow.org" target="_blank">www.endthemadnessnow.org</a> <S_SEP> , russians' involvement in the election i have never been a huge proponent of conspiracy theory but now:<br/>i have thought a great deal about trump's invitation to russian hackers to invade the trove of clinton's emails. given his narcissistic and grandiose character, i now wonder if this was nottrump's irrepressible and prideful shouting of deeds in progress with his awareness. i find it more than credible that he has been knowledgeably collusive with russian participation in the 2016 election. <S_SEP> , hacked, dnc it took a third rate burglary of the dnc headquarters in the watergate complex to expose the sinister aspects of the nixon presidency. nearly fifty years later a cyber hacking of the dnc headquarters is revealing potentially worse features of the trump presidency. while we are waiting for the facts to be uncovered, i hope we take to heart the lesson of not being conned by a candidate who promises much, delivers little, and seems to be more interested in feathering his own nest than in serving the people. <S_SEP> remarkable turnabout: last summer, when democrats were fuming about russian leaks of dnc and podesta emails, republicans' strategy was to put the focus on the content of the leaks (which never amounted to much beyond personally embarassing insights), not on who leaked it or how the data was acquired. now faced with quite serious allegations, republicans want to obscure the content of the matter and focus instead on how it surfaced. kill the messenger.
i' am reminded by the the recent antics and heat coming from the trump administration, over this brewing scandal, that most liars and con men commonly follow a predictable fall back when caught out in their lies or manipulations:<br/> attempt to distract the listener from their flim flam;try to implicate someone else in their lies;and if all else fails, try to make the lie go away by becoming aggressive with the listener... <S_SEP> , donald trump, discrediting comey trump is a walking, talking, tweeting, raging dumpster fire of a president.<br/>this could be the beginning of the end for the donald. trying to discredit comey and the fbi with another juvenile tweet was beyond stupid. the president who cried "fake news!" will not be any one's president at this rate. <S_SEP> the actions of the president prove to me he has something to hide and since he is all about himself his oath of office or patriotism mean nothing to him. that said i am disappointed in the rest of the gop and the people who voted for and support trump. its time to speak out, appoint a special prosecutor and get to the bottom of this, let the chips fall where they may and put it to bed. how would this group handle this if we took out the name trump and inserted clinton? <S_SEP> with his every move, trump demonstrates guilt. this is entirely beyond the pale. it is time for the gop to agree to appoint a select committee to put this issue behind the nation, wherever it leads. their arrogance in not doing so is literally without precedent, and their hypocrisy in the wake of treatment of clinton, to say nothing of obama, is outrageous. but the most outrageous thing of all, and the most dangerous for this country, is the fact that fully half of its citizens still do not seem to care at all. <S_SEP> all along people have been warning trump that his constant lying about little things like the size of his inaugural crowd was going to come back to haunt him when he needs the people's trust. well, now that the wolf is at the door, it might be too late for him to learn the lesson of the boy who cried wolf.
i am thinking about the same things you are. i feel america can re-right itself domestically eventually but the global catastrophe trump envisions is truly going to be the end. period. why not write a letter to the editor of the nyt for publication. honestly your comment as is would be a powerful message. thank you for reminding everyone that our own palace intrigues need to be put into a much bigger context. thank you. <S_SEP> i fear a major global crisis in on its way - the ultimate distracting event. <S_SEP> fascinating? the destruction of democracy in america is "fascinating", kl? america is not "kingdom" and there is no place for palace intrigue here. <S_SEP> honestly, i would prefer inaction to the continued destruction of what has been accomplished over the last 40 years. <S_SEP> american's can't take their word that their was no untoward contact because they had already claimed that there was no contact. it is as if a person found proof that a lover staying overnight with a rival after vociferously denying it. that lover might say, "nothing happened," but i doubt that statement would be reassuring. if we took trump's "word," we'd all believe thousands of new jersey residents cheered the deaths and destruction of 9/11, that his was the greatest election victory since reagan, that millions were able to vote illegally. etc. his word.
we the people must demand that the election be invalidated and that a new one be held now.<br/><br/>we must not let this stand in america unless we want her destroyed. <S_SEP> we the people must demand that this election be called invalid and that a new presidential election be held.<br/><br/>this must not stand in america unless we want her to be destroyed. <S_SEP> return the election to the person from whom it was stolen: hillary rodham clinton. <S_SEP> oh please. please find something to get trump out. please. i love obama, i could tolerate hillary. i'm a liberal, progressive, a good person, not like those nasty republicans. isn't there some way we can disenfranchise those who voted for trump? please. it isn't fair he won. he couldn't have really won could he? it must have been comey, the russians. somebody did it. it couldn't have been because the electorate didn't like hrc and repudiated 8 years of obama un care for the good old us. somebody stop the madness. <br/><br/>progressives are beyond belief. <S_SEP> meanwhile, trump is still out there holding campaign rallies, and his fans are still chanting "lock her up." it's as if we are stuck in a collective bad dream.
i haven't been to dc in 2 years. my last visit was to attend the cherry blossom festival. luckily, we hit the date right. walking to the tidal basin and seeing the entire periphy respemdent with those beautiful white (i always thought they were pink) flowers was breathtaking and ethereal.<br/><br/>we were wondering when to re-visit dc. love the smithsonian and there is something special about the monuments to our history. from the lincoln memorial to the washington monument, the reflecting pool. the gorgeous capital, the majesty of the white house, jefferson's monument, the vietnam wall, wwii, korean war, fdr and mlk tributes. the heart swells with pride. we are the united states of america.<br/><br/>so, i need some help. i want to visit dc again. but i want to do it when the guys in white coats are chasing the trumpster with large white nets on the west lawn. then i will know that the union has won another civil war. <br/><br/>and then i can go back to dc. and rejoice in our core values.<br/><br/>life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. with liberty and justice for all. untainted by the influence of a foreign adversary. <S_SEP> feeling a little bit grater today. thank you mr so called president <S_SEP> you're right, but i intend to help them along: <a href="http://taxmarch.org" title="taxmarch.org" target="_blank">taxmarch.org</a> on saturday april 15th. coming to a city near you! <S_SEP> i watched the hearing from beginning to end and it may be very proud of the work of our public servants. thank you. <S_SEP> thank you for these original, thought-provoking comments. and if you aren't located in idaho, you should be praised for personal courage, also.
as a registered long time liberal rockefeller republican i can not but weep at the state of affairs of the party of lincoln. they have let our party be hijacked by a charlatan who has soiled the office of the presidency of the united states of america. since i go back to the nixon watergate debacle that i dismissed as only politics, i can not but state that this so called president's behavior and trespasses are so ominous and unpatriotic that they make what nixon committed in the early 1970s look like a child play.<br/>nixon did not collaborate or hired people that collaborated with our existential enemies as this lair has done and keep bragging about it. is there any patriotic decent people in our republican party left to hold this lair accountable for his trespasses. i hope so because without those decent members of the republican party i am afraid we are in for a long years of mischief and danger under this con in chief. <S_SEP> the hearing yesterday revealed a republican party willing to sweep election tampering by a hostile foreign power under the rug. during the nixon impeachment hearings, there emerged numerous republican heroes, those for whom party loyalty was secondary to love of country. perhaps it is too much to hope that some congressional republicans have, at their core, patriotism that demands that they focus on the threat to our democracy. history will judge harshly those who impede this investigation. <S_SEP> i was a young voter, and vietnam vet, when the nixon house of cards fell down. however, nixon was not an insane candidate, and while certainly corrupt, didn't have the ties to a sworn enemy. then there is the digital world now that complicates the whole matter. it's now both easier and more difficult to hide. the entire republican party is a party to this, and seems little interested in either the truth or their own country, let alone democracy. to quote one of trumps utterances: "sad". <S_SEP> jroebuck:<br/><br/>i can't give you a president (unless nixon counts -- that was how this business got started). but i can give you white house officials lewis "scooter" libby, richard armitage, karl rove as well as journalists robert novak and judith miller.<br/><br/>then there was sec. of labor raymond donovan. remember him? after his acquittal he asked "what office do i go to to get my reputation back?" <S_SEP> this administration can only be described as the second nixon administration on steroids, and is overshadowing that administration in the content and quantity of lies and makes nixon's dirty tricks appear to be amateur hour.
russia tried to hack the rnc and failed at the same time they successfully hacked the dnc and podesta.<br/>what were they going to do with a successful hack of the rnc - help clinton? <S_SEP> 2 -- - you can goto the website <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com" title="fivethirtyeight.com" target="_blank">fivethirtyeight.com</a> and they show using statistics and polling that the email drops had a huge effect on the election. <br/><br/>3 -- that does not mean trump did not coordinate with the russians. the russians could have had the emails and then went to trump.<br/><br/>4 -- no hard proof but every us spy agency said they hacked the russians hacked the emails. do you want the us spy agencies to release their evidence and put people and their methods out in the open? <br/><br/>5 -- the "russian" dossier was garbage - you know it. fake news. - well half the dossier has already proven to be true. also one of the russians suspected of being in the dossier was murdered. <br/><br/>6 -- then why did flynn lie again and again about it. why was flynn telling the russians not to retaliate. why did trump not want the russians upset after they hacked our elections. i thought trump would hold foreign powers accountable and not push the us around.<br/><br/>7-- yes it is suspicious why trump would want to bully our allies in europe and asia and even mexico but hug the russians. <br/><br/>8 -- there are a lot of circumstantial evidence so far.<br/><br/>9 --so he could win the election. the russians have blackmail on him. so he can make money.<br/><br/>10. there are only dots for now that are being connected. they are not imaginary. <S_SEP> here's a dot... be so brazen and open about it to publicly request russia to hack hillary's emails. a request so bold and crazy no one would actually believe it if it were done. <S_SEP> i'm sorry to disagree with the venerable nyt's editorial board and it's thousands of devoted followers but this is all beginning to sound like a mccarthy witch hunt. <br/><br/>no, trump didn't collude with the communists to release hillary's e-mails before the election. how many resources are we going to devote talking, let alone investigating this? <br/><br/>how about discussing the important issues at hand, such as health care, the budget cuts, our faulty electoral process, the supreme court nominee (interesting the the nyt didn't allow comments on its scathing editorial of gorsuch). <br/><br/>no - let's obsess about whether trump should apologize to obama for his ridiculous tweets and whether trump colluded with putin to release hillary's e-mails. <br/><br/>those issues are going nowhere - and very slowly.
i fully understand the need to feel concerned about mr trump. i also understand your fear that his election was influenced by the russians. that such things should never happen is unexceptionable. <br/><br/>and though i hate "whataboutery", it seems to me that the us must be a bit more honest about what it has been up to in influencing elections in other countries. or is it the case that while it is perfectly all right for the us to do what it does, it is not all right for other countries to do what they do? <S_SEP> the really sad news of the day is just the logical outgrowth of what has been the most narcissistic, egomaniacal, dishonest president in modern history. in the end (three months into his tenure) america is being held hostage; its foreign and domestic politics subsumed by a pathological liar, his childish tweets and obfuscations occlude everything rational and important before us today. the elevation of our national discourse, post election no less, to a back and forth about lies and innuendo does a disservice to the nation that is beyond comprehension. yes, special prosecutor is needed, and we will all brace ourselves for a protracted back and forth with the egomaniac in chief. in the meantime the rest of the world will just watch as we make fools of ourselves for months if not years. we all burn while trump fiddles. such a shame. <S_SEP> does anyone else remember the tape of obama speaking with putin, saying obama will have more flexibility after the 2012 election? anyone remember the republican rage? those same individuals who called out obama for that "scandalous" conversation, refuse to acknowledge trump as a russian puppet. after watching maddow last night concerning konstantin kilimnik, there is not a doubt in my mind that, given the proper investigation, donnie moscow will be impeached. key word: proper investigation. <S_SEP> i'm sorry, but matt tabbai is wrong on this one. backing down is what trump what's and what democrats always do. not this time. there are very real crimes here, now whether those crimes include collusion we just don't know, but there are plenty of other potentially illegal issues with trump and his team and russia. no, we definitely must not back down this time.
innocent people want to clear their name as soon as possible. that pretty much says it all.<br/><br/>the real questions are how quickly can we get a thorough investigation completed? if it finds the criminality we all suspect, what happens to the trump presidency? putting pence in charge is not the answer. another election? how would that work? what if gorsuch is confirmed? does he get to stay, or can that be undone? and on and on. <br/><br/>we should not have to endure any legacy of this illegitimate administration other than the decimation of our standing in the world, which i hope is not irreparable. <S_SEP> i'm going to buy some stock in a vodka distillery. i already say nazdrowya. the russians are coming, the russians are coming!<br/>there certainly is more to be investigated here than republicans insisted on white water or even bengazzi .<br/>why all the false denials if there was nothing to hide? maddoff gave us more last night on msnbc.<br/>it's time to chant "lock them up".<br/>remember there is only one federal crime that qualifies for the death penalty. <S_SEP> trump can solve the mystery but he won't unless he is forced to either directly or indirectly by congress. <br/><br/>what is most distressing to me is that there is not unanimous support for getting to the bottom of this. if it turns out to be nothing of consequence in regards to preserving democracy and protecting the constitution, then we move on. <br/><br/>so, why wouldn't any president want to do this? i think republicans are delusional if they think this is going to go away without the mystery being answered. i'll go further and state that until the truth is out, the president and the republican congress is illegitimate and everything they do is automatically illegitimate. <S_SEP> the article starts, "the acknowledgment by james comey, the f.b.i. director, on monday that the bureau is investigating possible connections between president trump’s campaign and russia’s efforts to sabotage hillary clinton’s chances is a breathtaking admission."<br/><br/>they knew about this in july, 2016. the dnc warned the press that it was happening. president obama knew it was happening and, because of the relentless attacks on he and his administration for eight years, he let the system "work". <br/><br/>the press allowed the con don to "call in" with his cataclysmic claims and attacks on our governments. <br/><br/>the press, in their sophomoric coverage of the supposed election, made a popularity contest out of it and attacked ms. hillary rodham clinton about bogus e-mail claims, don't trust her and other non-policy issues. <br/><br/>now we have this. the con don and the top 1% global financial elite robber baron/ radical religion good old boys' party/ corporate cabal alignment with putin, erdogan and other "strongmen" who want to destroy the world order and remake it in their destructive image.<br/><br/>will we allow our democracy and world to be destroyed by these few money-power-grubbers? will we allow our children and grandchildren to be killed in another of their senseless testosterone-driven wars? <br/><br/>it is time for a new world order where the constant destruction of civilizations stops. step up, women, and make it happen now!
what we don't need is an investigation that drags on for years while the country is lead by an increasingly unstable and incompetent president. <S_SEP> what's the timing to begin impeachment procedures against the liar in chief? <S_SEP> i would say this now: should trump and or any one of his thugs try to impede this ongoing investigation congress (we the people) should begin impeachment process immediately. <S_SEP> so, let's play this out. if (and that is still a required word here) collusion is shown between the trump campaign and russia, what then? both trump and pence benefited from the collusion, so do both get impeached and tried (under article 2, section 4 of the constitution, which allows for all civil officers to be impeached), and what is the standard of proof? if mike pence did not know (likely) is he still liable because he benefited from the outcome? if not, then he becomes president. do we invalidate the election and hold a special election (nowhere in the constitution)? or does the presidency go to the "second place" finisher (at least in the electoral college) because the election would then not have anyone with a majority in the electoral college? the house would have to vote by states, but that requires a 2/3 quorum, and more than 1/3 of the states are run by republicans and could refuse to vote. or does paul ryan actually end up as president? legal people, weigh in!<br/>where, in all this, do the american people win?
if russia had influence before the election what would make them stop now that trump is in power? it seems that most of the steps trump has taken as president are detrimental to our country. with "friends" like this who needs enemies? <S_SEP> if russia was in any way connected with the release of honest information about hillary tryng to influence the election by undermining sanders that would seem to be an honest attempt to enlighten the u.s. voting citizenry. and who has more dots to russian than hillary and her sidekick podesta both of whom have had direct ties with russian activities lately? if all the u.s. politicians who have been working with russia in trying to make a buck in recent months were placed end to end they would reach from washington to crimea with some distance to spare. the russia influence on the election seems to be hidden in a curtain of speculation involving the hillaries, podestas, mccains, and other washington figures. any influence russia had seems to have been constructive in exposing hillarie's sand bagging of the sanders campaign. <S_SEP> what about oil? i thought this was the obvious reasoning. russian wants the sanctions lifted so it can export their oil. look at who was chosen as secretary of state , an oil executive who can oversee a deal with billions in profits. hasn't also been reported that there in the dossier trump was to receive funds for cooperation?<br/>follow the money , follow the oil. <S_SEP> but her emails !<br/><br/>how did we get to this point ?<br/><br/>a few too many meeting with various russians. i had no idea that meeting with russia is part of running for high office. later, possibly, and then you sup with a long spoon.
i'm afraid the most plausible scenario is that the house and senate will do nothing about this and we will be stuck with a deeply compromised president for four years or more. and that trump will not like this (he almost pathetically craves respect) and will eventually do something really drastic. <S_SEP> trump ran for president so he could be his own law, could punish and humiliate whosoever he chooses. now he is finding that being president only "sort of" works that way. you can make a huge mess of things and make life (more) miserable for those like illegal immigrants, poor, sick and old who may already be miserable, but you are limited (so far) in what you can do to those with money, lawyers, and rich friends. mostly his attacks disproportionately will impact his voting base, but not his fundraising base.<br/>i am sure that trump believed he could just drop investigations that he did not wish to see completed, and fire any lawyer who ruled by law rather than trump decree. so far he can't. keep fighting.<br/>there is at least a remote chance that some republicans will eventually realize that trump is a likely threat to them, and start to do their jobs--but not yet. <S_SEP> i for one am a doom and gloom person. i say the american political system is dead and sinking. we can blame citizens united for this. money has taken any chance away of ever ending this experiment peacefully. <S_SEP> yes the big fish trump is now stinking to high heaven.....he will be shunned by more and more republicans as the stink increases. make america great again.....we are tired of this dangerous buffoon. his real downfall began with the obama tweet.....he over stepped the limits of what a lot of decent people will accept.
donald trump's involvement with the russians can simply be solved by the completing the irs investigation of his financials. <br/><br/>the red flag of caution raised when he did not submit his tax returns, yet, his enamored supporters were excited like participants at world wide wrestling spectacle. <br/><br/>the question american never asked, is when does a life long millionaire or billionaire seek the opportunity to serve the american people and pass on making more monies for his corporations?<br/><br/>with his offspring firmly entrenched with their ears near their father, the president of the united states. will the family forgo profit making ideas that are a part of their dna to work diligently for all american citizens?<br/><br/>question, how long does an irs investigation take place? <S_SEP> , wikileaks, rachel maddow rachel maddow is doing congress's job. her program should be required viewing for all patriotic americans.<br/><br/>when will congress investigate the grifter family's azerbaijan crimes?<br/><br/>when will wikileaks release the grifter family's tax returns? if they have cia materials, then they surely have his financial records, including all tax returns.<br/><br/>when, oh, when? <S_SEP> in 2008, junior trump told a business conference that ru$$ian money was "flooding into" trump organization projects, prominently the trump soho hotel.<br/><br/>45 made the trip to moscow in 2013 for his beauty pageant bizness.<br/><br/>there is the matter of the quick $60m profit gleaned by trump's sale of a fl property to a ru$$ian oligarch at a time when he was facing a yuge cash flow crisis.<br/><br/>so revealing the entire, current tax returns would reveal to whom he or his biznesses owe money, to whom he has made or from whom he has received payments, and who are partners in his 500 or so llcs.<br/><br/>it is hardly mccarthyism to ask questions that 45 has refused to answer, and that the press has been loath to pursue vigorously, jerry. <S_SEP> wait! where's the "he's going to become the richest man in the world" theory? skimming 20% off a $500 billion russian-exxon oil deal would be a lot of money for the first dealmaker. remember, his "catch me if you can" remarks during the debate. "i'm smart for not paying any taxes." imho ... this is all about becoming as rich as putin, if not richer. i had an interesting thought the other day. if djt was traded, say, to the seattle mariners and told he would earn $200 billion, but he would have to play ball like the democrats, does anyone doubt that he would do so with as much fervor as he is displaying now? it's all about the money.
it has been reported that the intelligence community (ic) is withholding certain information for the white house and also that people were arrested in russia who are accused of treason and working for america. this may lie at the heart of the hostility by the ic to trump. if the cover of 3 or 4 long term us moles in russian intelligence was blown just a few days after inauguration and the trump inner circle is suspected it would go a long way to explain what's happening. <S_SEP> , russians in trump's inner circle mr. leonhardt, your five possible explanations are all plausible (and frightening). but none of them explains why trump would go out of his way to demoralize and disrespect our intelligence agencies, and to de-legitimize our basic democratic institutions such as our press, our elections, and our independent judiciary. <br/><br/>there is another possible explanation: the people trump surrounds himself with are so unvetted, so propagandized, and so ideologically extreme, that russian intelligence could have penetrated trump's inner circle and be influencing his talking points, and no one would notice. <S_SEP> trump is a serial liar and cannot be trusted but the ny times should also be wary of possible lies by other people or institutions. clapper and brennan were caught lying or planting bugs in senate computers. comey was considered by some as the cause of clinton's defeat (yesterday paul krugman showed his personal animus again) yet now he's the main pillar of the investigation of the president, so a key ally of the democrats. all this is murky and open to deception and manipulation.<br/>we know russia spies on everyone--but so does the nsa even on the leaders of allies of the us. we also know that the us has a history of intervening in other countries' elections (for instance in the russian election in 1996--time magazine even had a cover bragging about it).<br/>when it comes to secret services citizens often think they know but they just believe whatever is fed to them. that is why getting to the bottom of this russian spying affair matters so much. yet it is already clear that clinton lost because of homegrown causes (archaic and unfair electoral system, failure on her part to campaign in some rust belt states, her closeness to wall street, purging of voter lists which eliminated african american voters...). putin was also convinced she would win and probably wanted to create a little chaos (and now he may not be happy with an ignorant, impulsive president). <S_SEP> @ liddy - for years we've been hearing all the same things you stated about the clintons without any proof whatsoever. what comes out of the mouths of delusional characters like limbaugh and jones is not proof. if there was money laundering going on it would not be that difficult to get publicly available documents and connect the dots. it's time consuming and detail oriented, you have to know the laws about what information has to filed, but it can be done. that is what is happening to trump. most of the evidence piling up against him and his cohorts is publically available open source information. make no mistake this is real evidence, his tax returns are necessary only to put a nice bow on it.<br/><br/>before you start going off about some vast left wing conspiracy to bring down trump, the most damning evidence against him is being brought to light by conservative activists, journalists and former ic members many of whom are being treated like pariahs by their fellow conservatives. they call us liberals nasty but i've never seen such hateful disparaging things and spurious name calling all being directed at conservatives getting to the bottom of this.
is that the best that you have? the issue is russia meddling in our elections, and if trump's campaign worked with them to facilitate that. nothing else matters. <S_SEP> yes, an independent counsel must be appointed in this matter.<br/><br/>but even that misses the point.<br/><br/>the point is the republican party's systemic effort to undermine the nation in their politician's pursuit of political power.<br/><br/>future historians writing of the current events will conclude that the republican representatives holding office between 2008 and 2020 were willing to put the country at risk in order to regain and hold political power.<br/><br/>their willingness to put the country at risk has been manifest in their efforts to default on the nation's debt, their refusal to participate in governance, their denial of environmental science, their refusal to support the nation's judicial system by keeping open unfilled judgeships, and now, their willingness to ignore the collusion between their party's president and the russian oligarchy to undermine the electoral process in our country.<br/><br/>there just is no other way to view the actions, the lies, and the propaganda put forward by the republican party.<br/><br/>but, just as in 1930s germany, the warnings fall on deaf ears of those voters who ultimately will pay a heavy price for the republican party's sedition. <S_SEP> independent committee, obviously is better than a dependent committee.<br/>but, either takes too long. don jon is unhinged! he needs to be recused (fired) now. if comey won't use section 45 to do it, we, the public, must push congress to impeach- now.<br/>i beseech, trump must be impeached. <S_SEP> select committees are still made up of politicians. . . with political allegiances. . . that can be pressured to skew the findings. because of this, i don't think i'd be alone in being skeptical of the findings of any political body, even a select committee.<br/><br/>i believe the only format with credibility would be a special prosecutor, and even that would have to have some strict guidelines to avoid the kind of fishing expedition that ken starr indulged in with bill clinton.
even if we were to obtain access to trump's tax returns, could we trust them to include all applicable information? this man gives every indication of being a pathological liar. why should we trust anything he says or any information he reports? an independent investigator is desperately needed for the safety of our country. <S_SEP> to put it simply, the notion that trump would reveal any illegal or treasonous dealings with russia to the irs is naïve. i would not expect his tax returns to reveal any more than another set of unanswered questions. be prepared to follow all leads to their conclusion. we need to go in search of what he has not declared. <S_SEP> i only know about the protections presidential tax returns likely have in the irs from an incident one my sisters' employees at the irs caused many years ago. this employee was investigating a tax return and mistakenly typed in the wrong social security number. loud alarms went off, the employee's terminal was locked, and armed guards came running. the employee had mistakenly typed in gerry ford's ssn (only one off from the needed number), when he was the sitting president. took a while to sort out and even longer for everyone to calm down.<br/><br/>i would guess that trump's return is far better protected inside the irs than gerry ford's return was protected decades ago. only a pretty large scale high-level conspiracy would have any kind of chance of getting the returns (and remember that trump's returns are big enough to take a good while to fully download and transfer to a thumb drive). accomplishing this inside the irs without a near certainty of discovery is very remote. someone trying this with the knowledge, skill, and authority needed would be well aware that they would most likely fail, and almost certainly be caught and prosecuted. <S_SEP> you may be correct, but we'll never know for sure until trump releases his tax returns. mccarthy's accusations weren't so easily refuted. the fact that trump obstinately refuses to adopt this simple recourse is pretty self-incriminating.
, mcconnell and one thing not mentioned... why would mitch mcconnell not do the cynical but political thing when staring down the barrel of a clinton presidency, and allow the garland supreme court nomination to proceed? might he have been told that there would be an october surprise that would push the election towards trump? oh my. <S_SEP> oh, but mcconnell did do the cynical and political thing by stonewalling any chance of garland getting on the supreme court. his party's approach for eight years was to block anything obama did, and the garland nomination was more of the same. it worked, too. had hillary won in november, but the gop held on to the senate, they presumably would have tried to block her nominees. it was all about obstruction. since the gop won the white house, they now get to consider a nominee more to their liking. that's easily enough to explain mcconnell's actions. <S_SEP> little or no attention has been paid to the logic behind the republicans' refusal to consider obama's supreme court nomination and their insistence that nomination of a replacement for scalia should be the prerogative of obama's successor. that was at a time when clinton was the overwhelming favorite to succeed obama. to me that suggests the gop was privy to information that led them to believe that clinton would not be the next president. <S_SEP> trump promised to clean the swamp. well. whether he does it or not - he certainly brought us a cesspool
i think it is time to use the "t" word. the fbi is investigating treasonous crimes. <br/><br/>naturally enough, the republicans, desperate to defend their pathetically incompetent and dishonest president, would prefer to have us think about illegal leaks. the reasoning must be that if we stupid enough to elect trump in the first place, we may be stupid enough to be distracted from crimes so serious that it is hard to wrap one's mind around them.<br/><br/>here is our chance to see just how well our constitution really works under the most dire imaginable circumstances. if the press and the judiciary do its respective jobs, i think we will be okay. but i am not sure. <S_SEP> not just the deputy ag must stand aside. comey, too, is deeply compromised by his carefully timed disclosures about clinton's emails, later found to be nothing. he violated justice department policy, selling his soul to get trump elected. <br/><br/>it was already outrageous, but now we know he sat on far more incriminating stuff about trump for many months. <br/><br/>don't put your faith in comey. the man cannot be trusted to do the right thing, and certainly his boss can't be trusted at all, as he's in this thing neck deep. <S_SEP> i would suggest that before you print the indictments and convictions you take something fbi director comey had to say to heart. <br/><br/>much of what we are seeing being leaked is second and third hand and contains substantial errors in facts and assumptions.<br/><br/>the ny times surely doesn't need a rerun of the types of echo-chamber turns that brought them such scorn on november 8th and 9th, 201'6. <S_SEP> the fbi?!! comey fixed the election...
few writers have picked up on the strange behaviors of rex tillerson, our new sec. of state. rachel maddow showed a video of a news opportunity with him in which andrea mitchell tried to ask him a pertinent question and she was unceremoniously shuffled out of the room as he stood there and ignored her. he will be making a trip to somewhere this week but refuses to take the usual number of journalists, or aides because his "plane is too small." what's going on in state? seems to me that this new administration is not worried that the state department is gutted already. tillerson looked calm as chaos swirled around him when andrea was removed. he continued to conduct a meeting with another official as if nothing were amiss. it was a bizarre thing to watch. tillerson has received awards from putin, tillerson and trump didn't know each other at all before the election and now he's our secretary of state? come on!! <S_SEP> she also had an interesting take on what is happening at the state dept as a part of all this. very odd the way tillerson has done or said nothing in regard suggested budget cuts that would cripple state. <S_SEP> rex tillerson. bff of putin. never met trump until he was nominated for secretary of state. if trump never met the guy, how did he pull out his name out if that magic hat when there are so many other more qualified candidates than an oil guy whose main job was to screw ant tiny country that had a drop of oil and no rule of law?<br/><br/>now the state department is slowly being turned into a ghost town with budget cuts and tillerson being pretty much invisible.<br/><br/>again, tillerson is bff with putin. dots connected. <S_SEP> mr. kristof, the decimation at the state departments needs scutiny also. top employees there are being fired, rex tillerson has no deputy, makes no comments when the press is allowed in to see a tableau of him at a meeting, smiling like a cheshire cat, while andrea mitchell is being ushered out of his office asking ignored questions. gen. mattis has said without an effective state department, he is going to need more bullets. what is going on and why has the state department's budget been slashed?
extraordinary forethought, deliberation, and sacrifice produced our american democracy, an institution so broadly admired and beneficial that, until recently, i never questioned its staying power. today revealed our democracy is at risk and we must demand an independent prosecutor. <S_SEP> logic says that if the trump administration was sure of its innocence in this matter, then it would welcome an independent prosecutor investigation to clear them, but, that doesn't seem to be the case. <S_SEP> in a normal world, we would see this drama draw out to a reasonable conclusion. we'd have a calm, independent, and orderly examination of evidence and fact. however, we aren't living in a normal world anymore. through some strange confluence of events we've entered a world where reality and imagination are existing in competing tandem. in this world, appointing an independent prosecutor makes perfect sense so there is very little reason to expect it might actually happen.<br/><br/>“if i had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense. nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't. and contrary wise, what is, it wouldn't be. and what it wouldn't be, it would. you see?”<br/>― lewis carroll <S_SEP> mr. trump, if you are as innocent as you claim, 1) insist on a special prosecutor and 2) provide your tax returns. end of the story.
"collaborative, bipartisan team of statesmen"<br/><br/>if only such things existed in the united states. <S_SEP> "a collaborative, bipartisan team of statesmen."<br/><br/>republican statesmen? now? in this congress? an oxymoron if ever there was one. <S_SEP> bipartisan team of statesmen? where are you going to find "statesmen?" i haven't seen any statesmanship since barack obama left the white house. <S_SEP> nixon<br/>reagan<br/>bush (w)<br/>trump <br/><br/>starting to see a pattern here?
and another, revealed on rachel maddow last night, is the admission on video of trump staffer j. d. gordon that trump personally approved the change in the gop platform to favor russia that both trump and manafort have denied. <S_SEP> rachel maddow has been connecting the dots. as to the republican platform change regarding the ukraine, carter page has admitted the demand for changes came directly from trump (probably at bannon's suggestion). they all lied about it. time for indictment. <S_SEP> , clinton-china scandal, irs's lois lerner it’s a pyrrhic effort to keep pointing out that nick’s “dots” are self-interested, unsupported innuendo by those who live in fear of a successful trump agenda and fastened on whatever pretext to delegitimize a president. it’s starting to get more interesting to simply accept that liberals are going to keep seeking to connect those manufactured dots … and note that nick’s are not the only dots out there that cry out to be connected.<br/><br/>we don’t even need to go to the 1990s and the clinton-china scandal. we can focus more recently on the “pay for play” shenanigans documented in how the clinton foundation made its money, with middle eastern potentates and even with russia … while she was serving as u.s. secstate. we can also connect a few dots between mystery figures in the obama administration and the irs’s lois lerner, who led an effort to demonize conservative not-for-profits in the lengthy run-up to the 2012 elections, that narrowly re-elected president obama and barely staved off, yet again, a republican senate. in ms. lerner, we have a yuge dot in that she saw fit to take the fifth in congressional investigations. who did give her the necessary marching orders?<br/><br/>these “dots” don’t constitute unsupported innuendo – they’re documented. they’re just not something republicans have chosen to pursue, busy as they are turning nick’s politically-correct kumbaya america into something that actually works for americans. that is … not something they’ve chosen to pursue yet. <S_SEP> in exchange for russian help, “the trump team agreed to sideline russian intervention in ukraine as a campaign issue.”<br/><br/>they did that. they changed the rnc plank to eliminate military support for the people of ukraine. donald and manafort both said they knew nothing about it, but they were fingered by the russians.<br/><br/>steele's dossier is checking out in every respect. but spare me the golden video.
, russia and usa affair, indictments yesterday, was a tipping point for our nation. an amazing display of competing loyalties was on view. the intelligence leaders, comey and rodgers, had dual missions. first, to clearly define their respective independent responsibilities, while also fulfilling the "public's right to know", in an unprecedented clear fashion. their findings:<br/>1. no credibility to trump's claims of surveillance<br/>2. there is an ongoing investigation into ties between russia and the trump campaign<br/>3. they are early in their investigation<br/><br/>the republicans demonstrated a very enlightening but disappointing display of partisanship. their only thrust, was to complain about leaks to the press and not the fact that the us was attacked by a foreign country. they were more intent in discovering who told about the events than who perpetrated them. amazing! <br/><br/>much like watergate, where 40 + people were indicted or went to jail, there is little doubt that some current players will be going to prison too. when that realization firms up, we will witness a mass exodus and turning of loyalties towards self-preservation. trump and the white house will collapse under both the pressure of scrutiny and the abandonment of current "false" allies.<br/><br/>this is a momentous time for the country. it is leading us, once again, in the direction of reaffirming our principles despite disruptions and bad intentions. <S_SEP> the approach taken by the republicans at monday’s opening hearing on the involvement of russia in the 2016 presidential election brings us back to 1735, and the trial of publisher john peter zenger. yes, the parallel is not exact, but the zenger legend and lesson remain instructive. having published attacks on the governor of new york, zenger was to be found guilty of libel, even if what he printed was true. his lawyers convinced the jury to bring in a not guilty verdict, despite the undisputed fact of publication.<br/><br/>in similar fashion, the republicans on the committee seem committed to making the hearings all about the leakers, than about the russian connection, if any, to the trump campaign, even if the leaks were true. <br/><br/>leaking can be dangerous to the security of the country, although it appears to be ubiquitous in washington. coordinating with russia to undermine the american electoral process, if such is the case, certainly trumps the leaking of true reports of such conduct <S_SEP> good news, we've been here several times before, but not for sedition! if trump is smart, he leaves before the evidence is undeniable.<br/><br/>expecting this to go like a mobster's trial, with lots of money spent working up expert excuses like the wikiwhackjob's attempt to say anything is spooky possible, but probably not, trump. <br/><br/>cia can't help it if trump's folks turn to russians under surveillance for support. like we don't know how much russians have stashed in lepen's inkwell. trouble is, if we tell, then they know our tellers. <S_SEP> i am an ex-naval intelligence officer, cold war veteran. the call to "get the leakers" terrifies me. here's why:<br/>1. russia has meddled in our presidential election to benefit one candidate over the other; the evidence is overwhelming<br/>2. that russia-preferred candidate won the election<br/>3. that russia-preferred candidate and the political party he is aligned with don't like the publicity this legitimacy-sucking set of events presents and will do whatever is necessary to kill this story<br/>leakers are the brave patriots who put country before partisan politics and should be given all the protection afforded by whistle blower protection laws.
slightly nuts: buddy take an objective look! maybe from the perspective of someone outside of america's increasingly dangerous partisan political situation. america you have been here before and what happens next is bloodshed and civil war etc is that what you want? you have a toxic administration that is dividing your country and has a great effect on the rest of the world and guess what we are not impressed!!! get rid of it!!! <S_SEP> now what does an american patriot do on the ground in the face of a psychotic, morally bankrupt administration that is tearing and burning empathy, love and the bonds of all citizens ? <S_SEP> it is possible to believe that at the heart of the usa is a bitter, superstitious, minority that needs guns and an enemy in order to feel good. the terms of their discourse leads one to believe that they have left their minds unanalyzed and unexamined. their thinking seems to have uncritically accepted values and traditions that run counter to the realities of science and history.<br/><br/>perhaps they feel that they have been mislead by government and need to rely upon local customs and ideas about what constitutes life on earth rather than politicians or experts. <br/><br/>they now have a leader with a world view commensurable with their own ignorance and superstition. he loves their attention and their devotion. like some old rocker, on tour, who belts out the same old licentious stuff night after night without any home life to ground him - a terminal adolescent forever seeking more attention. <S_SEP> trump supporters cultish worship of trump to the point of ignoring his obvious and treasonous affiliation with enemies of america is the more dangerous form of mental illness.
you completely miss the point. i have no heard one person say that "the russians stole the election." it is the attempt to influence the election, possibly in concert with trump, that is the problem. <br/><br/>get your blinders off and stop creating straw men. <S_SEP> , russian's hacking of clinton's emails you're leaving out candidate trump's inviting russia to hack clinton's emails.<br/><br/>and speaking of republicans and the extent of their mendacity, if not criminality, in stealing elections in recent history there is: nixon sabotaging a possible lbj peace deal with vietnam before the 1968 election, nixon breaking into the democrat watergate headquarters before the 1972 election, reagan's arranging with iran not to release the american hostages before the 1980 election, and bush's accomplices in florida and on the supreme court throwing him the election in 2000.<br/><br/>you'd think voters would learn by now what the republican party really stands for. <S_SEP> we should be worried that trump and russia may have colluded to sway the election in his favor but remember hillary had 75% of all the superdelegates wrapped up before she even announced she was running.she just didn't need russia to cheat sanders out of the nomination. it is all rigged who are we kidding? <S_SEP> carl: "how were people's minds hacked? " because the wikileaks released only emails from the dnc side (and strategically timed their release to distract from negative news occurring on the trump side)... if someone doesn't think the "practices" of the rnc wouldn't be eyebrow-raising, there's a bridge in brooklyn for sale. <br/><br/>and never mind the fact that the "practices" of hillary's campaign that were exposed, weren't really that eyebrow-raising to begin with.
dream on. no trump appointee at the justice department is going to appoint a special counsel, and republicans in the house are not going to adopt a bipartisan approach to allegations that imply their electoral victories were tainted. there's a lot more tweeting to be endured ... <S_SEP> i'd add trump's furious denunciations of leakers.<br/>he seems completely unconcerned about problems with his staff but rather furious with those exposing them.<br/>and last, add his bizarre behavior with staff. michael flynn is a case in point . . . trump offered his full-throated support of michael flynn and believes what he did was appropriate. he then fires him because he didn't tell pence? . . really?? <S_SEP> if we did not have the leaks, we would not know any of this was going on. yet that little weasel gowdy seemed to only asked questions about that. we need leaks from career government employees who will not stand by and let our country be taken over by foreign interests. bravo to them. expect more outrageous tweets from trump, but i bet he senses the end is near. bravo! and goodbye. <S_SEP> while so many condemn and denigrate pres trump the same voices should be as interested in uncovering the source of the leaks information and the skullduggery of podesta, brazile, and other dnc operatives. both parties leave much to be desired from our professional political class. who are supposed to do what is right for our country.
, ties between ukraine and russia and clinton my money is on the corruption theory. he is probably up to his hairline in debts to putin's bankers. it would not be surprising to find that like his buddy paul manafort, he has some very unsavory ties to the russian or ukrainian oligarchs. perhaps both. either way the pressure must be maintained and increased on mcconnell to approve a select committee or independent commission. we will know what this president knew and when he knew it. no excuses. <S_SEP> what if there is no evidence or not enough evidence of collusion between russia and the trump campaign to remove him? does that mean he is free and clear to continue as president? there are so many actions he has taken and so many outrageous things he has said that should disqualify him. he is so obviously unfit to be president that just his conflicts of interest or something would be enough to terminate his presidency. although i hope the ties to russia work, i hope his removal from office does not hinge on this issue. <S_SEP> you can't put out that much negativity, lies, deception, mendacity and hatred without it having come back to bite you somewhere, some time. <br/><br/>donald trump is doing what he's done his entire life -- lie, cheat and steal -- and line his own pockets. the only difference is that now he's accountable, whereas before he got away with it.<br/><br/>bluster. lawsuits. arrogance. out-and-out willful falsehoods. he's clearly mentally ill and i think there should be a whole expose done about this. he's obviously not a well man. <br/><br/>when this cheaply built house of cards falls -- and it will -- bigly -- let's hope he doesn't take the entire country down with him. <S_SEP> when putin tires of trump he will continue undermining the us by releasing transcripts that indite trumps campaign and administration for collusion.<br/><br/>when putin decides trump is no longer useful he will show him to be a "friend of russia" to create more havoc in the us.<br/><br/>the sad truth is the "liar in chief" still thinks he is the "only" one in charge.
jon, let me see if i can repeat that - you are comparing a reporter leaking a debate question to a candidate to russian hacking into emails of the dnc and podesta and leaking the contents in the hope of swinging an election to a weak, vain, and incompetent candidate for their advantage, and the lying under oath, under oath mind you, in cabinet confirmation hearings. <br/><br/>if that makes sense to you, it tells us what we need to know. <S_SEP> even the extraordinarily wise james madison could not possibly have foreseen the party-first, hold power at all costs, unpatriotic, take no prisoners republican party of now. one of the most troubling aspects of yesterday's republican focus on leaks was the complete lack of acknowledgement that mr. flynn, a trusted trump advisor who took money from russia and lobbied for the turkish government while he was attending national security briefings may have committed acts of espionage. <br/><br/>in reply @ james lee arlington, texas <S_SEP> let’s be perfectly clear now. although one cannot say for absolute certainty that the russians sabotaging of our election and comey’s raising the empty specter of e-mails at the last moment; one can never say for 100% certainty that the election results would have been different; up and down the ticket, but i join many americans in feeling that we were cheated out of a decent future for our country. the only just solution is to completely redo the presidential elections. i would also include the congressional elections, but, at this point, would settle for a new presidential vote. everything that happens in washington now is illegitimate. <S_SEP> apart from john mccain, i'm not seeing much backbone from the republicans. if the gop stonewalls and there are more damaging leaks, this foot-dragging could backfire on them. they would be seen as co-conspirators.<br/><br/>the reported volume of calls between the campaign and russian officials makes me suspect that there was a coordinated effort to damage clinton's prospects.
no one argues that russia attacked america. russia, china, north korea and probably several more. what are we doing to stop it and why haven't we had a counter attack? if you believe that trump is in cahoots with russia, that doesn't explain why obama and probably even bush haven't had solid efforts to attack those who attack us. <br/><br/>where is our war against them? why aren't our leaders pushing on that instead of worrying about who might have said what?<br/><br/>it political to keep pounding trump. it would be better if we had our leaders (all of them) focusing on how to stop this instead of political theater.<br/><br/>and leaks are as much an attack on the us as hacking. a crime is still a crime. <S_SEP> we need an independent special counsel, to look into the russian file, tax returns and conflicts of interest. left to the republicans all these issues will be swept under the rug and america will suffer the more. <S_SEP> the rush to judgement of one actor in our political theater is clouding our political horizon. if there is a legal trial of any sort and he is found guilty he will be removed from office and replaced by mike pence. this strikes me as a smokescreen. we should kiss the russian investigation good bye and concern ourselves with much more troubling prospects which are being rushed through congress and are bound to bring real problems for many of our citizens.<br/><br/>this is a can of worms i'd rather keep closed. mr trump has enough good advisors to stumble through the next 21 months when we can, if we have joined our senses by then, elect a more democratic house. <br/><br/>i have my fingers crossed and am not studying the cyrillic alphabet. <S_SEP> , russian money republican heads would be exploding if hrc was president and there was a fraction of the evidence pointing at trump. the manafort connection and the trump jr comments about russian money connected to trump along with all the favorable comments about putin should be more than enough for extensive investigations. unfortunately the republican congress is more than willing to sweep it all under the rug in hope implementing their perverted policies that will harm the majority to the benefit of their 1% masters. if the obvious evidence continues to grow even republicans may conclude that self preservation requires congressional action.
trump appears to be at war with his own government and, by extension, his own country. his behavior, over months before and after the election, strongly suggest a culpable link to russia that he's trying to hide or deflect from. <br/><br/>methinks thou dost protest too much, mr. president. <S_SEP> no matter how often trump tries to distract the public with tweet storms and pathetic claims of "fake news", the truth will come out. trump is an abject failure who has damaged our country immeasurably. the sooner he his out of office, the better off we will all be. time for a special prosecutor. <S_SEP> funny. trump has been proven to lie about 70% of the time. he lied about the weather for god's sake. do you really think trump or anyone colluding with him has any credibility whatsoever? <S_SEP> occam's razor tells us that the simplest answer to some question is probably the best explanation. the simplest explanation of trump's statements about russia or lack thereof is that he is trying to hide something.
"at last, a grown up takes the stage -- democratic congressman adam schiff -- and what he lays out at the house hearing, in a crystal clear, lawyerly way, is damning: the likelihood that back in july, just before the republican convention, the trump campaign cut a deal with the russians as follows."<br/><br/>barry -- you want to know why this country is in the mess it's in? citizens like you. have you any ability whatsoever to think for yourself? or if you see it in the times, hear someone talking into a microphone -- that's enough for you?<br/><br/>schiff offered proof of nothing. <S_SEP> adam schiff's opening statement should be printed in full on the front page of the nyt. it does a better job of outlining the publicly available facts than any article i have read over the last 3 months. it is decidedly not a partisan argument for investigation but a patriotic american one. this is what it means to support and defend the constitution. republicans should get on board and stop deflecting, denying, and obstructing the process. <S_SEP> the truth. ah yes, the truth. who's truth seems to be more the question in mind. do we believe rep. schiff's truth? or do we side with the republicans? do we think it is possible that the president of the most powerful nation in history is a congenital liar? for myself, i find it incomprehensible that anyone could not see that trump is this nation's worse president since richard nixon. it is with some irony that i see how obsessed trump is with nixon. he called hillary's "scandals" worse than watergate. hillary was worse than nixon. trump then accused anyone of calling him out as fake. trump slanders his critics by accusing them of lying about him, about being worse than watergate. trump accuses his critics of practicing "mccarthyism". most people today were not around during the mccarthy era. if you were, you would know how serious a charge like that was. <br/><br/>now we have a resurgence of mccarthyism, of watergate like behavior, of dirty tricks. dirty tricks by the way was a term coined during nixon's tenure. and one of nixon's loyal soldiers in the cause and dirty trickster was, lo and behold, one roger stone. yes, the web of lies and deceit is vast, complex, and complicated, more so than even health care. roger stone has a tattoo of nixon on his back. ask him to take off his shirt, if you dare. what we are witnessing is the very beginning of nixon redux. stay tuned. it is only going to get worse, much worse.<br/><br/>dd<br/>manhattan <S_SEP> i think it's safe to say at this point that the house gop, its base, and donald trump have approximately zero credibility and that their intent is to "make donald trump great, not america, and that in fact, this fiasco stew of treason, lying, and slander have rendered republicans, as a group, not credible for the foreseeable future when they wave their flags and declare that they put "country first." <br/><br/>they don't. if this was hillary clinton or pres. obama, impeachment hearings would already be under way. i was disgusted watching trey "never enough benghazi hearings" gowdy yesterday. please, s. carolina, don't re-elect gowdy.
mr. kristof indeed connects the dots. he appears to still be reluctant to use the word that is also emerging as the dots are connected: "treason." it is time to call it what it is. this was the coordinated effort to work with a hostile foreign power to alter the course of a u.s. presidential election. what we don't yet know for sure, is how much of the administration's activities since the inauguration are payback to russia for services rendered. <S_SEP> mr. kristoff may have hit the weak spot on trump's outrageous claims of his alleged wiretapping. people do have a panicked tendency to lash out against a perceived threat by trying to divert attention away from themselves. <S_SEP> kristof omits another important point. during the drafting of the republican platform, a long-standing plank about providing lethal (weapons) aid to countries threatened by russia (like the ukraine) was dropped. there is no clear public accounting, and trump says his people had no role, but some present complained that trump representatives insisted and got their way. <S_SEP> mr. kristof, you forgot one dot. as widely reported at the time, during the republican convention, the trump campaign showed absolutely no interest in shaping the republican party platform, with one interesting exception: they intervened to kill a proposed platform amendment calling for maintaining or increasing sanctions against russia and increasing aid to ukraine, including providing lethal defensive weapons to ukraine. of course, the trump campaign at first denied any involvement in having the proposed platform amendment squashed, until they later admitted their role.
the question is: how can russia use whatever they have on trump to their advantage? getting him to change any policy under threat of exposure of information is unlikely to influence him. exposure of either sexual misconduct or financial misconduct would not embarrass him as he has already shown himself to be a proud miscreant on both of these. <S_SEP> , russia and trump, ideological alliance it appears that all of these five pieces are necessary to explain trump's behavior, like genes in an organism. if i were to rank the different explanations from most to least dominant, it would be 2-3-5-1-4.<br/>the first explanation is just a way to rationalize his behavior. i do not think it is the root cause. if the last explanation (an ideological alliance) is true, then trump is a home-grown putin, functionally no different from the home-grown radical islamist.<br/>"russia is a ruse", he recently said. his recent tempered stance on russia may be just the flip side of that: a ruse to make us think that there is nothing there. <S_SEP> comparing the obama administration's reasonable "russian reset" attempts to trump's curiously cozy, possibly treasonous relationship with russian intelligence is preposterous. <S_SEP> , russians and ukrainians' affair its close to the point where there are no more spaces between the dots to connect anymore! next could we find out that he named his daughter ivanka, which is a russian name, feminine for ivan, is putin's god daughter, that his marriage was arranged by the kremlin, that his wife is a kgb spy, that he did have a secret server to communicate directly with russian his ny apartment, that he gets retreated by his handlers at his florida estate weekly, that he, well, would anything be a surprise anymore?
russia isn't ever going to moderate the refugee crisis. they are quite happy for the flood of displaced refugees to continue moving west into eu and nato member populations. then they get to coordinate with alt right and nationalist propaganda outlets to scare those people into backing isolationist and nationalist politicians allied with putin.<br/>i don't know if this was the plan all along or they just used the situation to their advantage. either way the right in america need to realize that putin is the reason those syrian refugees don't have homes anymore and that he is playing everyone else for fools. <S_SEP> , radical conservatism, immigrants the european far right is being energized by a tsaumni of non-european immigrants and refugees, not by putin's financial support. most of these immigrants and refugees are muslims whose bigotry and radical conservatism far surpass that of european alt-right. for example, the european far right thinks women should be permitted to appear unveiled in public. <S_SEP> "but remember that obama never came up with an effective approach to syria. "<br/><br/>oh ? and what, exactly, do you think obama should have done ? asked for a pink pony and nice nice from assad ?<br/>sent in a few divisions of us troops on a direct collision with russian military ?<br/>armed isis ?<br/>i mean, you got better ?<br/>in the real world, sometimes, no matter how horrible something is, there isn't a good solution (although obama could have done more, i think without congress, to help syrian refugees) <S_SEP> i get your irony man, all these rather-primitive conventional missiles the gullible iranians have to settle for once they decided not to go on the military-nuclear course (and against strategic israel). by the way, they build and pay for the missiles themselves, not the russian – real losers, believe me.
, russia and israel, aipac until trump and russia, the country which has had the most covert success in literally buying control of our politics has been likud israel, russia's arch-enemy. never in history has a tiny country like israel quite literally bought control of a great power's legislature, and executive (when obama is not president) the way israel, through aipac, adelson, and the rest have bought ours. israel, of course, claims to be "our greatest ally in the middle east" (which is hardly hard to be), yet it's actual goals for the past twenty years have been to use the american military to launch wars for "regime change" against its enemies in iraq, and now iran. wars which have had and will have devastatingly negative consequences for america itself, totally wasting thousands of american lives, hundreds of thousands of middle eastern lives, and many, many trillions in new national debt, while "accomplishing" only the ever-wider spread of muslim hatred of america. it remains to be seen what putin and trump have in mind. hard to believe it's good. but we know what bibi netanyahu and shel adelson have had in mind for twenty years, and it has been entirely disastrous. too bad we can't start investigating that undermining of america by a foreign country right along with our investigation of russia's. <S_SEP> how about all of those russian built missiles iran has pointed at your house? if you're israeli you might want to consider that. <S_SEP> the conversations in the times whether in the op ed or the comments seem to ignore the fact that we are the ones that started a war at russia's southern border, overthrowing ukraines elected president and installing poroschenko a puppet of ours, israels and the oligarchs who strip mined russia during the nineties and are attempting to turn it into their own fiefdom, controlling the resources no matter the misery to others. there was a veritable blackout on news surrounding this and the clinton/nulands/pyatt involvement in the coup but the fact remains it happened. reuters, haraatz and other legitimate news sources regularly reported on the whole sordid affair, one not dissimilar to what we did to egypt when they elected someone not approved by us and israel. it seems we chose sides early in the game and as mr. steiglitz observed in his excellent comment we have the hawks in chief mccain and graham as cheerleaders for a war with russia. rather than the continued nonsensical op eds about the republicans are bad, democrats are good, we should step back, see what is really going on and not being reported on before we have another "w.m.d. moment", but this time with someone who can fight back. overthrowing small countries for big oil and israel is one thing, but to start a war with iran and russia is insane, they can be part of the solution as kerry observed, but never as apparently in neo con fantasies will they allow themselves to be taken over, so stop the drumbeat for war. <S_SEP> a nation that is indifferent that its president is a liar, corrupt and bought off by corporate and foreign interests is not a great nation. it may have economic and military power, but such power is analogous to a criminal state- a mafia chain of command- conferring "power" but no moral legitimacy or respect. <br/><br/>this is why the press, concerned americans, activists of all persuasions, courageous politicians, principled judges and others in all walks of life who speak for the truth- are so important. without them- and only the tide of uninformed mass opinion- the democracy would easily slip into dictatorship and its decline rapid and final.
anyone who thinks that americans are all riled up at those bad leakers is as delusional as trump, and that is going a ways. without leaks we would not know that our national security advisor was in cahoots and being paid by foreign governments. we are better off keeping that a secret?<br/><br/>btw, the leaker is probably bannon, a demented bomb-tosser suffering from munchuasen syndrome who should not be anywhere near the levers of power, much less have his evil hand on them. <S_SEP> please, patriotic leakers, continue! it is the only transparency the american people are ever going to view, amidst the darkness of the trump administration. <S_SEP> this column is way less alarmist than it should be. we're talking about a sitting president who may owe greater allegiance to a hostile foreign power than to the country he leads. we shouldn't be talking about that as if it's some minor policy disagreement.<br/><br/>as has been pointed out; the flood of leaks is a cry for help from the adults in the room: the intelligence agencies. <S_SEP> if people who actually care about democracy in the us had not leaked vital information america would now be further down the road to becoming a criminal oligarchy. the leakers are patriots and heroes in my view.
, foreign policy, russia and usa relations i concur with all mr. leonhardt writes. i wish that president trump would make a speech in which he outlines his relations with russia and how they fit into his views of the us relations to nato and the eu; with syria, turkey, and the kurds; and with israel and iran. after all, the president has the authority to set foreign policy. citizens also have the right to know whether that policy benefits the country or the business interest of the president. <S_SEP> this is great- very logical and very scary. another dot is trump's baku hotel. the new yorker wrote a piece about it this week. i hope the nyt will look into this story. keep putting the pressure on trump. do not let this russian story go. this is the story. <S_SEP> please. you are undermining yourselves and all of us by taking the russia story far beyond the realm of reality. back up, look at the real issues and evidence. and give the many other terrible things the trump administration is doing the attention they need. this russia story is just going to backfire on you all. <a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/taibbi-russia-story-is-a-minefield-for-democrats-and-the-media-w471074" title="http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/taibbi-russia-story-is-a-minefield-for-democrats-and-the-media-w471074" target="_blank">http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/taibbi-russia-story-is-a-minefield-...</a> <S_SEP> so the administration response to the clear and unequivocal statements of the danger russia poses to this country is to have the secretary of state skip the nato meeting with our allies and go to russia instead. when is the gop going to understand the damage this man and his cohorts are doing to our national security.
i'm old enough to remember the watergate hearings. i worked at a restaurant a few blocks away from city hall and i'll never forget the politicos coming down the street during their lunch break to play pool, have a beer and a sandwich, and watch haldeman, ehrlichman and especially john dean testify. rule of thumb? the truth always comes out sooner or later. it always turns out better for everyone if it's sooner. <S_SEP> charles<br/><br/>i am more than twice your age. this is the biggest consititional crisis in my lifetime, significantly bigger that watergate. <br/><br/>that was purely domestic, and involved a corrupt president. his vice president, spiro agnew, was corrupt as well and resigned in october 1973 in connection with a msryland state bribery scandal. nocon resigned on august 9, 1974. <br/><br/>this administration may break all of nixon's records. <S_SEP> follow the money!! it was great advice during watergate and it's the best advice now. all will be revealed if you just follow the money. <S_SEP> from watergate all the way through the pedophilia in the church, it has been journalists who have been best at finding the truth by digging the dirt. thorough investigative journalism takes time...i, for one, hope the best available are on the job! the results will be spectacular!
start the impeachment motion now, republicans. you are to blame for this unfolding disaster. you may save face by doing the right thing for your country now. the connected dots are there for all to see, and you in congress swore to defend and protect the constitution of the united states of america, not the actions of the twisted mind in the oval office. do your duty! <S_SEP> talk to your senator, mr. rubio. <S_SEP> your comments need to go to every gop senator in the form of a letter and i intend to plagerize your excellent commentary and do just that. <S_SEP> each of us must insist that our elected representatives do their jobs and follow their oaths to serve the country (not the trumpster-fire currently occupying the white house). get on the phone!
, vs usa gowdy is a menace to democracy and must be thwarted at every turn. i would refer mr. gowdy and readers, to "new york times co. v. united states, 403 u.s. 713 (1971)". this landmark ruling by the us supreme court held that the ny times and washington post could not be blocked nor punished for publishing the then classified pentagon papers. the revelation of these documents showed that the government possibly under eisenhower and kennedy but definitely under johnson, had lied repeatedly about the vietnam war. the court held that, "to exercise prior restraint, the government must show sufficient evidence that the publication would cause a “grave and irreparable” danger." in the case of possible involvement of the russians with collusion from trump and/or his associates in attempting to unlawfully influence the 2016 election, the exact opposite is true. the opposite in this case, is that failure to publish will cause irreparable harm to our democracy. the prosecution of daniel ellsberg, the leaker of the pentagon papers probably would have resulted in his conviction had it not been declared a mistrial when it was proven that president nixon had paid someone to break into ellsberg's phychiatrist' office and steal his file in the hope of discrediting him. ellsberg said at the time and since that he fully expected to go to prison for life. hopefully the gop won't find the leaker or leakers in the current case or they will flee to a safe haven overseas, paris perhaps. <S_SEP> there was a fair amount of testimony from comey about how wrong nyt (in particular) has been concerning this whole issue - and no mention of it here (or elsewhere in the paper). incorrect and selective reporting are both consequences of biased journalism. <S_SEP> trey gowdy was on full display as the black-hearted partisan he is. the manipulation of our system by a malevolent foreign actor doesn't register with the likes of mr. gowdy; it simply provides yet one more opportunity to name democratic names and intimate that they have done something wrong. for gowdy, the only treason here is that leaks have cut the republican agenda -to erase obama from history- off at the knees. i imagine he is experiencing withdrawals from his benghazi boondoggle. <S_SEP> gowdy released the name of a cia source illegally during his witch hunt against hillary. it was inadvertent but it was still far worse than anything they ever found that hillary clinton herself did. he's not in a strong position to claim to be nonpartisan.
personally, i love twitter trump's tweet this morning: "james clapper and others stated that there is no evidence potus colluded with russia." he goes on to say "this story is fake news and everyone knows it!" <br/><br/>he's right - everybody knows that there is evidence potus colluded with russia. we just have to uncover it!!!<br/><br/>donald trump will be the first american president convicted of treason!!! <S_SEP> mr. trump, the fact is the scent of treason permeates the air.<br/>it follows you everywhere.<br/>you lead our country to the slaughterhouse of truth.<br/>yet you offer not a scintilla of proof.<br/> proof of anything.<br/>the stench of your tweets and lies belie everything.<br/>absolutely everything.<br/>do the right thing.<br/>now.<br/>go away mr. trump. go away.<br/>take your comrades and go away.<br/>the footprint of decency and democracy shrink with every breath you take and every word you make. ( sorry sting for the paraphrasing)<br/><br/>sincerely,<br/>chris yurkanan<br/>grandson of slovak immigrants<br/>son of george and mary frances<br/>70 years old <S_SEP> nixon was a punk crook compared to the treasonous benedict donald. tricky dick committed criminal acts, but didn't threaten our democracy by attacking its first principle, the vote.<br/>russiagate cannot be left unattended.<br/>even republicans will see this soon, and the special prosecutor and impeachment proceedings will commence.<br/>then we'll see some even weirder tweets. <S_SEP> i cannot even believe we are having this conversation re the office of the president of the united states of america and the collusion with the czar of russia and his murderous cohorts. shame on you trump and the rogues under you! they say that a persons greatest strength can turn out to their greatest weakness. well then mr. trump you just outdid yourself. it was only a matter of time before you used up the rope you were given to hang yourself.
a special prosecutor is the only acceptable solution. "bipartisan" committee? hah! just obfuscation and diversion by the republicans. the fbi? yeah, right - headed by a right wing tool, comey, who went into the tank to throw the election to trump. the doj? dictator donald will just fire everyone who does not suck up to him. i am not just ashamed, but disgusted and repulsed by what is happening to my country. <S_SEP> shades of watergate. but the yugest, most consequential difference is good luck finding patriots like howard baker, lowell weicker, elliott richardson and william ruckleshaus, who all put country ahead of (republican) party back then among today's republican party.<br/>i would be happily astonished if an independent prosecutor was named. just a suggestion, but preet bharara is available, and has a proven track record of pursuing government corruption in both parties. i wouldn't bet a dime on republicans agreeing to a special prosecutor, or select committees in congre$$, let alone a mortgage payment. <S_SEP> manafort was dropped because probing was just getting too close for comfort. nick kristof is correct. the whole saga stinks to high heaven. i am just one powerless member of the american public, but i am outraged that we have been duped by a cadre of liars, thieves, and conspirators. t is a cruel, crude fraud. we are totally reliant on serious and meticulous probing of this convoluted scheme. somebody can get those tax returns. that information would blow the whole thing open. <S_SEP> don't miss the forest for the trees. unlike nixon's watergate, that cover-up was by nixon and his merry men. for trump the "who, what, when, and where" is out in plain view, with his campaign/administration a leaking sleeve of information (most in his org. seem to suffer from ego, pride or both). the "why" that really helps pin it down is being covered up by the republican controlled house, senate, and justice department. taxes are just one example they don't want you to see. but, like watergate, the free press can make the truth come to light and set us free.
, iran-hostage crisis, russia and u.s. election pence said “of course not. why would there be?” we don’t know either, mr. vice president."<br/><br/>the russia-trump connection-is. what is it?<br/><br/>apparently standard practice at this point. <br/><br/>read pg 420 of oliver stone's "the untold history of the united states". there is described how regan supporters (including george bush, bill casey and robert gates) bargained with iran before the election of regan, to keep the iran-hostage crisis going till after the election. the republicans made a better deal than carter did, who, as president, offered up to $500 million in arms to iran. carter wanted them released before the election, which it was thought would have cinched the election for carter. <S_SEP> i always thought this was the gusher when others keep harping on the pee party. it's not intelligence unless you read it. <br/><br/>totally freaked carter page is promised transactions of shares in a russian gas company when things are over.<br/><br/>trump wants know why carter page keeps showing up in the press acting nervous? i'd be nervous too if i were the pin that sticks these dots together. that's why he's pressing it, so they can't have him murdered quietly, as seen on tv. <S_SEP> nixon's boys scuttled the paris peace talks for political advantage. costing and additional 25 thousand americans deaths and many more shredded for life.<br/>reagan's goon, ghwbush, did the same with the iran hostage talks, for political advantage.<br/>gwbush, rose to office on the back of some very shady dealings. (which dems were too weak and feckless to battle).<br/>the last 3 gop presidents were run from saudi<br/>are we surprised this president will be run by russia?<br/>see you in costa rica <S_SEP> yes, and they seem to be insulating him. flynn's big sin seems only to be lying to pence.
my goodness, your logic, foresight, and amiability are beneath reproach.president trump won the election. get a life and get over your petulant whining.....prove one word of those emails was falsified. you know the ones that showed hrc and here minions were a bunch of lying, cheating hypocrites. her lemming like followers are even worse, otherwise normal people should know better virginia. <S_SEP> don't like the message? destroy the messenger. <br/><br/>then deflect, deflect, deflect. <br/><br/>last time i checked, neither hillary nor barack were in office. <br/><br/>don't like the idea of congressional investigations, richard? what changed? you sure did like 'em when it was hillary's emails or benghazi they were investigating. <br/><br/>you know, richard, having to actually govern is much harder than just being obstinate, as you are now learning. <S_SEP> when you show me the e-mails from the rnc, for comparison, then we can perform an honest analysis. right now, it is simply partisan rancor against the democrats. <S_SEP> i believe that all the other craziness going on with the administration (wiretaps, et. al.) are simply an attempt to divert attention from this way more critical, and impeachable, issue. please do not let up on this subject. you proved your tenacity when you incessantly covered hillary's emails, costing this nation its well-being for the next four years. now please use that same approach on this truly relevant story.
great summary and more than enough for an honest and impartial investigation to proceed, beginning with a subpoena for ten years of trump tax returns. but if you think trump only "sometimes seems unhinged" you should pay more attention. if you look up unhinged in webster's dictionary his picture is there. even on the evening of his address to congress, when so many gave him credit for seeming "hinged" and "presidential" , he could not resist calling attention to himself at the expense of that poor grieving widow....sad <S_SEP> there is a more simple reason for trump's coming unhinged, and that's his inability to put up with any sort of criticism or scrutiny.<br/>it feels like we're going to end up with a lot of smoke and no fire. the tax records are probably the only solid evidence and the republicans leading the investigations aren't about to seek those.<br/>they don't want to know what's in them, until at least after the mid-terms and probably not even then if they can keep this leaking ship afloat till then as they try to gut the social safety net and shift taxes off of the wealthy enough to turn the federal government into a helpless shell. <S_SEP> others in these comments have underlined the "unhinged" used by mr. kristoff. the diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm), in the section on narcissistic personality disorder (which according to the manual mr. trump fits), says: <br/><br/>... criticism may haunt these individuals and may leave them feeling humiliated, degraded, hollow, and empty. they may react with disdain, rage, or defiant counterattack...<br/><br/>i find that description very much predictive of what we can expect; last week mr. trump may have felt humiliated by the recusation of mr. session, and during the weekend his rage exploded to attack mr. obama.<br/><br/>another predictive passage in the dsm is: "though overweening ambition and confidence may lead to high achievement, performance may be disrupted due to intolerance of criticism or defeat". so i expect that during this presidency, because of the criticism and defeat that will come at times, his performance will be very much disrupted. <S_SEP> to me, it remains almost beyond comprehension to put the words president and trump in the same sentence, much less adjacent to one another. his legacy is going to be a disgrace to the nation, i'm sorry to say.
donald trump is under the delusion that he's a dictator, and the morally bankrupt republican party is enabling this criminal. it will collapse. trump has built his illegitimate reign on hatred, lies, and racism. the core is rotten and the frame is rickety, it will not last. trump and his putrid administration is the worst in modern history: george w bush and richard nixon are being outdistanced. it will not last. <S_SEP> "fraud in the long red tie"<br/>the fbi and the nsa<br/>investigate donald trump's campaign<br/>and their view of our president's twitter attacks<br/>is that he's certifiably insane <br/><br/>so the house, the senate and his own executive branch<br/>have now agreed that the man doth lie<br/>how much longer can he survive himself<br/>this fraud in the long red tie<br/><br/>but kellyanne, bannon and good ol' reince<br/>will surely have his back<br/>stevie miller, ivanka and jared, too<br/>and of course, sean spicer, his hack <br/><br/>so he'll slash the budget and build his wall<br/>deprive health care to women and men<br/>lying, deceiving, ducking and weaving<br/>is how he'll make "america great again" <S_SEP> , nixon's difficult keeping ags this is getting more in the realm of nixon's difficulty keeping ags, and prosecutors out of jail <S_SEP> so what happens if they impeach trump? that means mike pence becomes president? be careful what you ask for people...
'that includes the most towering suspicion of all: that trump’s team colluded in some way with russia to interfere with the u.s. election. this is the central issue that we must remain focused on.'<br/><br/>in what way? this is fevered imagination stuff. donald trump may be many negative things, but a vassal of the russian government he is not. why do you persist in this ridiculous delusion? <br/><br/>this article is innuendo and garbage. the left leaning liberal media cannot accept the truth: trump won because of massive dissatisfaction with the way america was being run and the left wing liberal bias of so much of the us's state apparatus as well as the mainstream media. <br/><br/>mr kristof, you sound like a nutjob. obsessed or even possessed. just give it up. the russians did not determine the outcome of the us presidential election: the american people did it all on their own. you and your ilk actually helped them to reject the massively 'recommended' candidate. <br/><br/>if you want to get rid of trump, try some other line to 'russian poodle'. the latter is farcical. <S_SEP> mr. trump never wanted to win. he always wanted to be "a winner." he never wanted to govern, but he wanted to be seen in the oval office - gold gilded now, just like trump tower - as the president of the united states. he has always been the ceo of his daddy's business, but he was never a real ceo responsible to a board of directors and shareholders. he has been a one-man front office, an executive producer, able to say "you're fired!" without consequences.<br/><br/>the problem with wanting to be the winner and wanting to be the president, but not really wanting the job is what happens at the end. he ran, he won, and he now has the office and the responsibility to govern. but he never wanted to govern and knows nothing about doing so or about picking competent people to do it for him. the result is what we have seen: extremist views that match his rhetoric, people with sullied or unknown pasts, and now, complaints about ties to the russian government. all while two of the most powerful men in his administration silently and almost invisibly manipulate his strings as they work to destroy completely the administrative order.<br/><br/>it is a sad state of affairs for our country and the world. i doubt we, other like-minded countries, or the environment will be able to turn things around. four years is a very long time. we have been at it for less than 100 days of them. <S_SEP> "active measures" a new yorker article details russia's strategy to influence the presidential election of 2016. <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/trump-putin-and-the-new-cold-war" title="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/trump-putin-and-the-new-cold-war" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/06/trump-putin-and-the-new-col...</a>. the writers conclude that russian interference was only one reason that trump was elected.
i never thought i would live see a real-life version of "the manchurian candidate." . it's simply astounding that this is happening and that the republican congress doesn't really care because this way they can ram through legislation that furthers their policies without regard for the integrity of their country or the american people. shameful. once their legislative agenda is taken care of, maybe they will begin to act slightly suspicious. <S_SEP> we needed the republicans to take this hearing seriously and put america first. instead they threw out the red herrings of leaks and voting machines <S_SEP> i think the rot goes a lot farther down the list, way past ryan.
we the people, citizens of the united states of america, must embrace our sacred responsibility to protect and defend our democracy. this is our time, our place in history to defend our nation against attack from within and beyond our borders. our national forebears gallantly fought against internal and external forces that would destroy our nation, that would destroy our democracy. our american patriots, who gave their life for our nation, look upon us from a distant shore, reminding us of our sacred duty as citizen to protect what they gave their life to preserve. our democracy. we are at a crossroads. we the holders of the trust of future generations of americans, must rise up to embrace the mantle of american patriot, to protect and defend our democracy against all those who seek to corrupt and destroy our america. <S_SEP> we we need an election do over. like europenew campaign six weeks vote..... <S_SEP> ...to be fair "replace" was a late addition when "repeal" alone wouldn't fly. and it was only muttered half heartedly.
, hrc, russia and gop, election rigging the chickens are coming home to roost and to aid trump in his laying of even more eggs as usual.<br/><br/>to repeat my note once again:<br/>trump ran for president - a great surprise to many.<br/>he did so because he knew he could/would win.<br/>his entire outrageous and offensive campaign, his demeaning attitude toward many groups of persons, and his blatant over-confidence/swagger were possible because he knew he could/would win. <br/><br/>the election is"rigged" he said.<br/>yes - for himself and not for hrc.<br/>he implied the "rigging" for her more than once.<br/>he and overt/covert operatives may know this to be the true case for him. <br/><br/>the main task is to find who they are and who they represented.<br/>who did it? russia or gop or trump or two of them as a combination or all of them together as one determined "400 lb. unit - sitting on a bed" of their own making. <br/><br/>why was trump so determined to ignore, drop, slide over the entire issue of the hacking of pre-election elements - the dnc for one.<br/><br/>to be considered is the hacking of the election in the compilation of the voting results received from all of the states.<br/>meeting predetermined results is possible in the computer software system designed to compile the final voting results in the aggregate.<br/>77,000 votes spread over 3 states - is computer manipulation child's play. <br/><br/>can this act be labeled high crimes or misdemeanors or treason?<br/>sweep the 2018 elections and impeach trump in the house.<br/>it couldn't happen to a more deserving guy ...... or plant. <S_SEP> so, trump was right: the election was rigged...and stolen. <S_SEP> while i agree with mr. kristof, trump does not have to disparage president obama to appear unhinged. but i digress.<br/><br/>what needs to happen here is that some guy like flynn needs to be immunized and hauled before a grand jury - followed by manafort. that same grand jury can subpoena trump's tax returns.<br/><br/>the american people need to know exactly how we did this to ourselves. no president has ever been more obviously unfit for office.
just wondering. so what next? the fbi finds proof that trump and his gang of thugs colluded with russia to swing the election. does he remain in office while they try him for treason? what about the rest of them? i doubt there is a plan in place for that outcome so i can't help but wonder what will happen... i think the nyts should follow through with information on the follow through. <S_SEP> with the times and the wash post devoting a crack team of investigative journalists on this story of trump's russian connection you know the frank affair was but the tip of the iceberg. we are but a month in and there is so much intel to be culled. trump's pronounced denials of any collusion with russian only makes them more convinced there is one. and then there's the myriad trump conflicts of interest. he has already violated so many of those laws in but his first month in office. the counterattack against trump is mounting. it is just a matter of time before the drip, drip, drip becomes of deluge of incriminating evidence against trump. we've only just begun.<br/><br/>dd<br/>manhattan <S_SEP> watched the hearing start to finish. nothing "haunting" other than comey implied the nyt often prints--to paraphrase--propaganda for self-serving reasons. but what is "haunting news" is the fact that both hillary and obama--she for treason, he for being her willing accomplice--have so far avoided leavenworth. still time--though. obama malfeasance is forever.
heard this one before? the times is calling for a special prosecutor. <br/><br/>folks, here is how it works. basically, if there is a republican administration, the times favors special prosecutors/independent counsels, but when there is a democratic administration it opposes it. (remember kenneth starr, anyone?).<br/><br/>just last september, times legal affairs columnist, linda greenhouse, wrote about trump's call on the justice department to appoint "a special prosecutor to investigate whether donors to the clinton foundation got special favors from the state department when hillary clinton was secretary of state". <br/><br/>greenhouse said that "appointing an independent prosecutor is ... a truly terrible idea".<br/><br/>what a difference a different party in the white house makes! <S_SEP> mention of a special prosecutor inevitably evokes painful memories of the stunningly vindictive overreach of special prosecutor kenneth starr. republicans would like to avoid doing to trump what they unleashed on bill clinton. <S_SEP> this is no more a "breathtaking admission" than when comey revealed the existence of andy weiner's cellphone during the hillary investigation.<br/><br/>lot of nonsense, fed by mainstream media "breathlessness," signifying nothing.<br/><br/>now, it is clear that nothing would make the nyt more "relevant" again than a "special prosecutor." wow. the good ole watergate days, or even those whitewater clinton days.<br/><br/>but, there won't be any "special prosecutor." nope, just like there was no "special prosecutor" for hillary and the clinton foundation. (by the way, how did all that uranium get to russia via hillary?). but i digress....<br/><br/>i truly do think the times still does some legitimate investigative pieces. the one you did recently on the militarization of the police was excellent, and it opened my eyes to the increasing incidence of raids gone bad through unnecessary force.<br/><br/>but your vendetta against trump is wearing thin. he may be slightly nuts, but it is clear that his campaign no more colluded with the ruskies, than the nyt colludes with islamic fascism by refusing to re-print charlie hebdo cartoons and thereby denying freedom of speech in favor of "not offending muslim sensibilities. <br/><br/>it would be cool if comey could give your newer reporters the "hope" of another "pentagon papers." <br/><br/>but i fear that "there is no there, there." <br/><br/>just the times, still trying to figure out how its election night assurance to its readership of hillary's impending landslide could be so wrong.
wait, isn't this the same mr. comey who was excoriated last year for helping derail the clinton campaign in it's final week by announcing she was still under investigation?<br/>i guess his "approval rating" by the nyt has now soared since he's investigating "twitler".<br/>overall, he and the group he runs, the fbi (fumbling bunch of idiots), are even worse "detectives" than most of the television show varieties. he was a jerk last year and he's probably a jerk this year no matter what or who he might be "investigating".<br/>certainly a "special prosecutor" is called for to, at the least, preserve the "chain of evidence" that the fbi will, more than likely, screw up. the sooner the better but i expect this batch of republican senators and congressmen will probably stall any such attempt.<br/>or mr. trump could just do us all a favor, resign, grab his golf clubs and head south preferably before he starts bombing north korea. <S_SEP> mr. comey according to the new york times editorial board may have interference from trump's justice department.....hmmmm...you mean something like president obama saying that hillary clinton did not violate national security. well, how would he know such a thing? or loretta lynch agreeing to meet with bill clinton 3 days before comey came out with the decision not to charge hillary clinton? and all bill and loretta spoke about was golf and grandkids???<br/><br/>seems we have seen this play before. <S_SEP> mr. comey has an opportunity to redeem himself (for what he did shortly before the general election) by conducting an impartial and thorough inquiry, and then appropriately informing the nation of his findings. he may yet be one of the more important fbi directors in history, if he does this.
the recent proof that the intelligence community can leave the fingerprints of any foreign intelligence agency to disguise their work casts all doubt on any assertion that it was the russians who colluded. it means we have no idea who actually hacked the democratic party. if the cia and nsa can do it, make no mistake: any first world and several second and third world intelligence agencies can do the same. <S_SEP> we had another time period when a no one connected the dots and the outcome was disastrous for america-9/11. hopefully americans are smarter now and realize that dots count as do words and connecting them is important. it seems unbelievable that wikileaks and russia believe that americans will keep falling for the same tricks over and over without connecting the dots wikileaks=russia.trump needs a full investigation of both campaign and now his administration or else the republicans will be responsible for the next disaster because they would not connect the dots. <S_SEP> republican representatives are so bankrupt that they would rather win with russia's backing than lose without it.
to para-phrase, "russia, i don't have any business with russia, i haven't ever made a phone call to russia!" yet this is disavowed by both his son's remarks (the son that is supposedly holding the trump empire in a blind trust, never to speak with his father until 2020 (or, horribly, 2024) and by the lawyer michael d. cohen and felix h. sater, "a business associate who has helped mr. trump scout deals in russia" [ny times february 20.] the new york times, an institution i hold dear (ah! the failing ny times fake news operation) has a very special job to do. unearth these presently alluded to activities. the very future existence of the newspaper - every newspaper - depends on it. <S_SEP> , russians' hacking of dnc, clinton's "haunting news" writes the editorial board. this would be a "haunting" issue only if the russians had truly hacked into the election and cast phony votes to manipulate the outcome. i do not consider the hacking of the dnc, clinton's, and podesta's email accounts haunting, but in fact helpful, in that exposed their corrupt, dishonest, and evil intentions. in that sense i applaud the russians! however, knowing now that the us lintel community community can hack into computer systems masked as the russians whose to say it wasn't the us "deep state"? at any rate, this story ranks at the top of the "fake news" stories and is just an attempt by the establishment to discredit and undermine trump because he not part of the political establishment. well, like it or not, he's the president, americans elected him; they elected him because they had had enough of politics as usual, they had had enough of the clintons, they had had enough of obama. ordinary americans, the so-called "deplorables" who value hard work and common sense elected trump based on his message for hope and change, not the lies and empty promises of the past, and especially not on inference by the russians or who claimed to be them. thank you. <S_SEP> why not do both? the fbi can, with help, do more than one thing at a time, i'm sure. they can investigate russian ties and leaks!<br/><br/>not that hard, so stop trying to raise smoke.
lived in dc during watergate and can tell you that this has the same sort of stink about it. could it be that the swamp trump spoke about was one that he added to? his actions in dismantling the federal agencies that make the government work, his appointments of super rich but anti-american voter cabinet level secretaries have that kind of slimy, wet boggy scent to them. and in april his sofs will visit russia instead of nato. hmmmm.. . . don't think he's bringing back his medal. more like doing the old kow-tow to the man who made it possible. <br/><br/>yeah, nixon supporters didn't believe that he could betray the country either. but thirty years ago you didn't have so much big money and gerrymandering neutering our congress. today, the party belongs to the mercers and the kochs and all the other money bags about to get their big tax break from cutting the epa and meals on wheels and the aca and the fda and all the other agencies that actually make life in the us possible for lots of people.<br/><br/>alas, too many of these people in a hand full of states will be getting a sad comeuppance for not being better informed. if you hated your government before trump, you will like it a lot less as the truly vacuous nature of dt and the republican party makes itself known. they even had their platform changed to make nice to the russians. puzzling then, but not so puzzling now. <S_SEP> in 1973, president nixon stated: "i'm not a crook." it took a lot of "trolling the waters" to eventually connect the dots of watergate.<br/><br/>the "everyone" that you cite are, in fact, not ready to "concede" that the election wasn't hacked. don't project your own narrow mindset onto the rest of us who want the truth exposed (and want to save our country). <S_SEP> the american civil liberties union filed a freedom of information request to make trump's tax returns public. if the aclu wins, the public will be able to see the details of trump's alleged business deals with russia. it seems evident that his returns are a public record because he is the president.
supposing there was something to all of these things? in that case, his motivation would appear to center around his financial interests, since not pursing any of the other things would impact negatively on his investment interests. quite honestly, i do not know why the press has been so willing to allow him to say that he has no connections with russia, when his own words contradict themselves. <S_SEP> trump's fondness for putin seems bizarre. putin is a vicious, murderous sociopath. it might be that trump is truly frightened of putin and gives him praise to avoid getting him angry. but nobody knows. for all we know, trump really does admire putin because he really is a dominant alpha male type leader. <S_SEP> the motive is much simpler. trump thinks, stupidly, that he can get some gains via old fashioned wheeling-dealing (including bullying) with putin. he thinks putin and he play by the same rules in their power games. by personally engaging putin in those games trump thinks he can win big for america and will be a hero. trump's thinking in this is wrong in so many ways..
i think they are betting that since they control two branches of government, and may soon control all three, unless the democrats come together to prevent it, they'll probably get away with obstruction of justice and collusion with hostile, foreign states. <S_SEP> , russia and u.s. election the administration will continue to deflect by dismissing any and all allegations as fake news. the president's party will support him out of their own thirst for power. nothing will happen unless or until trump is abandoned by the gop. what will it take for republicans in congress to suddenly lose their loyalty? <br/><br/>if there had been even remotely similar alleged contact between obama or clinton's campaign and russia, ryan, mcconnell and company would be screaming bloody murder! <S_SEP> yes, will, and as i have said before, russia takes all without "firing a shot."<br/><br/>we have a mentally unstable, russian stodge sitting in the oval office. and it appears we have a congress who are on board with trump/russian policies.<br/><br/>russia may not have expected trump to win, but win he did, and so did russia. they are licking their chops in glee.
russians forgives 367 million of trump debt in exchange for loosening sanctions which allows russia to bring in 5 times that. <S_SEP> i believe we are going to find that the russians are responsible for picking tillerson for state and ross for commerce. i believe that was part of the deal. i find it likely that lifting sanctions was part of the agreement (with tillerson at state to finalize a enormous oil deal that trump is promised a cut of, channeled thru a series of front companies). all of this will have been engineered by combining trump's greed as the carrot and blackmail as the stick. <S_SEP> bannon and mcconnell are collaborators. their reasoning is varied, from a sense of self-importance (bannon) to fear of making an open secret in kentucky public knowledge, thus damaging some of his credibility with racists and haters (mcconnell).<br/>both revel in the power of hate, as does trump. trump's own reason is that he was not as rich as he says he is until he got a massive input of funds from russian sources. this is all the more surprising because, before he started using his last name as a stylemark, trump was went bankrupt in his gambling endeavors. it is easy to separate a fool from his/her money--that's what gambling is about. it's easier to fail on the oldest profession (prostitution)--which is less of a hazard to family life--because whores purvey youth and attractiveness. with gambling, you only have to provide the "action." in other words, trump's business credentials are a sham.<br/>like trump, the gop depends on fools of voters who heed the lies to lose their livelihoods--and soon real liberties (our constitutional guarantees) to the unscrupulous. no wonder they collaborate.
quick means of ousting trump: repeal aca, pass tax reform, defund planned parenthood. the gop won't need him any longer &amp; they'll sell him down the river &amp; claim credit for saving the country. <S_SEP> pretty clear his own interest is to profit in the white house. it is obvious he is protecting his own wealth at the expense of the country, as his sons flit around the globe with expensive protection courtesy of us.<br/>he remains the sole beneficiary of any work done by his sons with his companies. his mansions and properties here and globally are protected at tax payer expense. protecting trump tower everyday might even bankrupt new york city. the donald would like that. maybe he wants melania to stay there, so he can purchase properties that cannot sustain 5th avenue being closed off as it is. we're sending the coast guard to protect mar-a-lago.<br/>private businesses are being destroyed at the local airport since no one can fly if trump is in town. that means no private jets, no flying lessons--it affects business that cater to airports. some will be bankrupted, some say entire airlines are moving from the airport there so they are not impeded. one guy was losing 50 thousand per day. <S_SEP> anyone can observe that something is terribly wrong with the presidency, many things are not normal! things are not getting done and they will never get done because there are many trust issues with this president! mr. trump might be putting on an act when it comes to speaking or tweeting about things that concern him! it makes us all wonder what is he doing? it is possible that he tries to divert the attention at just the right times to take the heat off the issue at hand! i am sure that because of his privilege as a global wealthy person he has many connections and business roles that are not conducive to being president. the problem is that he is having a role conflict that make the clintons look like the waltons!
that is, trump doesn't want america to be friends with putin's russia; <br/><br/>he wants america to be like putin's russia, an autocracy based on nationalism, a christian identity, plutocrats hand in hand with state power, and democratic forms without democracy. <S_SEP> dot 11: trump "friended" putin on facebook. <S_SEP> "ideological alliance", as mr. cohen suggests, would seem to be the overriding theme of this administration's embrace of putinism. none of the other possible motives connects the dots like the fascist culture that links russian and american paranoia in the face of global dislocation and religious extremism.<br/><br/>the excellent feb. 10, nyt article by jason horowitz, revealing steve bannon's interest in the italian fascist intellectual julius evola, opened up an illuminating perspective on the obscure mindset that trump and putin seem to share. reading translations of mr. evola's obscure philosophy introduces the reader to the alt-world of "white genocide", an ominous world view in which the connections between right wing america and post-soviet russia begin to fall into place.
mr. leonhardt, after reading your piece my first thought was an ayn rand quote "the question isn't who is going to let me; it's who is going to stop me"...why the complacency with potus regarding his accountability towards us the voters? why so many are staying quiet? why so many are not demanding transparency? could it be that too many are involved or too many feel the threat of been exposed (on both side of the aisle) to embarrassing situations? this is daunting and completely unnerving to see the level of "cover up" reaching to an unimaginable level of participants...which is the root of this unparalleled situation? who is going to stop this nonsense? maybe we reached to a political stalemate ? if so, who can break this deadlock? if democrats are not ready or capable to fight, or the gop is simply covering up their president regardless the seriousness of his non-accountability, then our last chance (under our actual government system) lays with the scotus...can someone please take all these non-sense to them? if we keep eluding to tackle this wild "bull" frontally then we will be letting him to do whatever he wants...and this is not an option...let's stop him! <S_SEP> irving,<br/><br/>say what? trump hasn't been cleared of the "salacious details" in the dossier. they haven't been proven yet, but other details in the dossier have been shown to be correct - so it may be a matter of time. (and mr. kristof didn't make the accusations, and is certainly not responsible for withdrawing them.) (also, why) do you care? they're icky, but not really pertinent to what the orange monster is doing to destroy our democratic republic.<br/><br/>as to the wiretapping, it looks like trump picked the idea up from his favorite news source, breitbart, well known for peddling right wing conspiracy theories. breitbart didn't provide any "evidence" either. since there is zero evidence to support the allegation, mr. kristof certainly doesn't have any responsibility to disprove it. <S_SEP> , gop rachel maddow's program last night was almost entirely dedicated to the "russian connection." one additional "dot" that was mentioned: the gop changed its platform to remove a reference to arming ukraine to counter russian aggression. she said a former campaign worker said the request to change the platform to favor russian interests came from then candidate trump. and we know that paul manafort was working for pro-russian individuals in ukraine. manafort had said that there was no trump campaign involvement in the platform.<br/><br/>too many denials from too many trump associates make the trump administration look highly suspect in the allegation of collusion with russia. representative adam schiff said he was willing to travel to london to meet with christopher steele. concerned citizens should support every effort to investigate the russian connection and present the facts to the american people. our democracy is at stake.
if trump fires comey and the gop does nothing, then the world is gonna watch us throw those bums out in 2018. <br/><br/>it was a long watch between nixon's plumbers getting caught and barbara jordon's ringing call for his impeachment. years. sheltering suspicious characters was all she kept harping upon; mobsters and burglars and obstructors, not russians! <S_SEP> when will comey apologize for throwing the election to a habitual liar, by announcing a (specious) investigation and ignoring a serious one that had been working seriously for months? and when will the times apologize for misleading its readers by reassuring us that there were no real dangers of russian intervention-- although we could see it with our own eyes? the damage is done, to the nation and to the world, and we will be watching it play out for the rest of our lives. but these acknowledgements would help us trust our intelligence community and our fourth estate-- although we've lost faith with the white house and the republican congress that cynically shields it. <S_SEP> it's more than clear.... if there's no fire behind the smoke then he has everything to gain by pulling back the curtain with alacrity.<br/>but he is guilty.<br/>.... then there'd be no need for these stupid 'rallies' and tweets....<br/>but he is guilty.<br/>... and appearances to the contrary, republicans don't have his back. they know he's a clown.... but they want to keep the basest of 'his' base, so they wait until the evidence of treason is unmistakable...<br/>.... but, my friends, don't wait too long....<br/>next comes 'the deal'.... with his fortune dwindling, according to forbes, he'll cash out when the heat turns up. impeachment ? no way....<br/>... rather he'll crawl back into the wall claiming he's been wronged, and tweet and tweet, while looking into a mirror at the one person he loves, and one of the few who don't see what he really is... a tiny, tiny man with a big, lying mouth.... who almost destroyed the nation.... out of hate and self-loathing...
oh, please, get your head out of the sand. trump owes russian banks money, wake up! <S_SEP> and follow the money through the bank of cyprus where the rooskies laundry their money and who has a vice president whose name is wilbur ross, our new sec. of commerce. <S_SEP> listen, anyone who has reportedly done business with someone named "fat tony" should be investigated in my book.
mr. trump is an ellipsis president, full of dots. if you believe there is a problem in this republican executive, dots right. <S_SEP> hope that the congress will accept your arrangement of the "dots." <S_SEP> the dots could be flashing and talking neon lights but the gop still wouldn't see them let alone connect them.
as the power of the executive branch has increased over time - laws are needed to increase the transparency of the parties' nominated candidates and of the executive offices. the nominated presidential and vice presidential candidates should have to release the last 10 years of tax returns. federal cabinet appointees have to release the last 3 years of tax returns. if there are concerning issues in the vetting process congress can ask for up to ten years of returns. the president and vice president should also be required by law to be at least as transparent. <br/><br/>the constitution should be amended to explicitly state that the emoluments clause also applies to the president and vice president.<br/><br/>without seeing trump's tax returns it will be difficult getting to the bottom of the russian connection. <S_SEP> there must be a way to accelerate this entire process. trumps tax returns must be obtained under subpoena immediately. they likely will tell a tale that will inform and accelerate where and whom to investigate further. in the meanwhile, a potentially treasonous commander in chief controls the most powerful military machine on the planet and has access to intelligence briefings on all other allies and enemies.....what could possibly go wrong! <S_SEP> there is only one reason that trump continues to protect his "precious" tax forms: revealing them would be much more damaging than the continued criticism he gets for refusing. when they finally get hacked, that when the whole thing will blow up in his face. the clock is ticking and he knows it.
more important now is what the motives were. there has been much speculation concerning trump's relationship with russian president vladimir putin. theories range from them being just two politicians who admire each other’s' leadership style to trump being a planted asset of the russian government. even more important is the possible consequences.<br/><br/>“…the question then becomes what did putin hope to gain by aiding trump? what russia and putin desperately need is money. even if putin asked trump to have the american treasury transfer, say $200 billion to russia, that is not going to happen. even kellyanne conway could not spin that one into anything that would be acceptable to the american people or congress. absent writing russia a big check, how could trump cause russia to gain $200 billion? the answer would be a $50 increase in the price of oil.<br/><br/>we know what has caused most of the oil price spikes in the last 50 years. that has been wars in the middle east. the first oil shock came with the 1973 war. twenty percent of oil traded worldwide moves by tanker through the strait of hormuz, the world's most important petroleum transit choke point. iran also provides various pathways that could lead to another oil price spike. there are also some who fear that even if trump was in absolutely no way compromised or beholden to russia, he could still stoke a war in that region anyway with some blunder or rash action..."<br/><a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/4034048" title="http://seekingalpha.com/article/4034048" target="_blank">http://seekingalpha.com/article/4034048</a> <S_SEP> "trump campaign advisers had close links to putin’s circle, and some of them spoke with russian officials during the campaign. "<br/>please give me a single name. trump indeed used some help from mr manafort, who indeed has some political ties in... ukraine. besides of him, you will not find a single person who has more or less significant ties to russian establishment. <S_SEP> are the generals he has brought in nuts? manafort and bannon, not to mention ivanka's cozy time in dubrovnik with putin's girl friend, would eliminate any chance of these people having a security clearance. these generals need to be very clear about who they will work with and then expel bannon, block any contact with manafort and send ivanka and jared back to nyc. basic long standing rules are being ignored. the fbi and cia need to get a grip but i suspect they will instead pursue people demonstrating much as they did under nixon and bush.
wasn't that clever of manafort to hire podesta's firm so people like you could come back with this? story needs a little fleshing out, doesn't it?<br/><br/>the hidden $13 million was given to manafort, not his firm. <S_SEP> you nailed it, sir. manafort has been open in saying that he wants world war 3. he's in charge in washington, not the buffoon, racist, woman abuser. yes, #45 is most definitely a part of it. he's a moron, focused on money. he doesn't care if the world blows up, as long as he has enough money to build a palatial shelter to hide from it. keep the focus on manafort. he does connect the dots and he must be stopped. <S_SEP> i don't think trump knew paul manafort before 2014. explain the whole "birther" conspiracy from 2009 which supposedly trump, a realtor, came up with and kept going for years all by himself to now particular end. the "birther" campaign to delegitimize the obama presidency - and putin hated obama's guts - may have been a russian project trump was dumb enough to sign up for - or may have been blackmailed into doing.<br/><br/>otherwise, how does trump as the sole face of the "birther" movement for years make sense? what was he doing it for in 2011? he had other ways to get media attention. why not consider "birtherism" was a russian project handed off to trump to give it a recognizable american face for our media?
i wonder does he consider his interference in the election collusion with russia's intent or just coincidental? <br/><br/>when he said that with no indication that he understood what it meant it only reinforced my view that the gop is the party of treason and every single one of them wants to destroy the usa in favor of trying to make their fantasy of a nation that has never and will never because it can never exist come to be. <S_SEP> , russian attitudes towards usa let me add some more data.<br/><br/>sessions met w/ kislyak for the 2nd time on sept. 8. here is what was going on at that time. three days before sessions met w/kislyak in september, obama met w/putin at the g20 summit. at the g20 summit, obama &amp; putin discussed sanctions that us imposed on sept 1, which putin said were inconsistent w/future cooperation. on sept 7, director of national intelligence james clapper publicly suggested for the first time that russia was behind the dnc hack. then, on sept. 8 - the day of the sessions-kislyak meeting - trump told a russian tv network he didn't think russia was behind the hack. that same day, trump suggested it would be "wonderful" if we had a relationship with russia. also on the same day, both trump and pence heaped praise on putin &amp; his leadership style. and, on that same day russia suddenly became optimistic about building good relations w/the us. in sum, at the start of the week, russia wasn't optimistic abt cooperation, but after the sessions-kislyak meeting, that changed.<br/><br/>here's the kicker: 5 days after sessions-kislyak meeting, the hacked dnc emails were released. boom. coincidences?? this should be on kristof's, and more importantly, congress's list. <S_SEP> i wouldn't be so quick to dismiss the jeff sessions connection.<br/><br/>i was just startled by the degree sessions went out of his way to perjure himself. when senator franken asked him how he would investigate alleged contacts between the trump campaign and russia, sessions answered a different question, and lied about it.<br/><br/>he denied his own meetings when he wasn't even asked about them. it's as if someone asked him "jeff--have you seen the butter?" and he replied, "no, and i haven't stolen any cookies from the cookie jar, either!" i mean, that's not the question we asked, but now we're really wondering about what's going on with that cookie jar.
the core of trump's motive is sheer overwhelming narcissism. as a result he feels he is above the law. there are countless examples from his soiled past to prove that claim.<br/><br/>impeachment is a real possibility. the sooner the better. <S_SEP> kevin,<br/><br/>impeachment is a political not a legal process! if "evidence" mattered wjc would have been impeached because he was a rapist.<br/><br/>you don't have the votes to impeach president trump and won't get them anytime soon. <S_SEP> before the election i snickered a lot. i have spent more of my life working in lock-ups than i should have. now that donald is actually in office i have lost my sense of humor.<br/><br/>donald has taught me a painful lesson. i thought america would be drawn in by him like a bride to a narcissistic mate. unconsciously, i also counted on her leaving him before he could hurt her. i was so wrong.<br/><br/>i have been around minor and major felons for thirty years. among<br/>the most confounding characteristics a small percentage display are 1) a willingness to engage in behavior that shows no regard for the feelings of others, 2) an absence of anxiety, guilt or empathy when real harm occurs and<br/>3) explanations for destructive conduct that at best have only a marginal attachment to the reality the rest of us know. i have watched psychiatrists trying to explain this unique, very destructive conduct calling it a "near psychosis."<br/><br/>at his core, donald thinks like a criminal. he fails the theologian's test<br/>that asks if he can experience the pain of another as his own.<br/>at the same time, america has a real struggle with knowing how to contain and direct those who lack a conscience. promising health care to everyone on one hand and unhesitatingly taking it away on the other is to be without conscience in the corporate form. profiting personally from his very remarkable status as<br/>president speaks to a lack of conscience on the personal level.<br/><br/>hold him to the rules---he cannot do it for himself.
i choose what's behind door #4. <br/><br/>"putin" is a known dog whistle to the alt-right. every time trump says the name it means "authoritarian white rule" to white nationalists. it is what both bannon &amp; trump believe in. neither bannon or trump believe in democracy -- in the least. they believe it is a an ideology that benefits mongrels and has always been antithetical to white people (the great and sole builders of civilization). brannon's aim is to sow so much chaos as to destroy democracy. putin's strongman stance is precisely what b &amp;t want to replace democracy with. <br/><br/>sure, there might be some business entanglements, but trump's aim is far more sinister -- so much so that even the most outraged liberals don't know what they are really dealing with. and no, this is not a conspiracy theory. read what bannon has written and said in the past. read who he has read and quoted. recognize the full import of trump installing bannon in the white house. <S_SEP> it circles back to two things, i believe -- ideology and follow the money. the first is the most sinister, terrifying, and, perhaps,, the least understood by those opposing trump. i am just beginning to wrap my head around it. <br/><br/>bannon. it's all about bannon and trump looking to tear down our government -- indeed, our entire nation -- in service to their ideology. bannon is the brain, trump is a believer who carries iy out. bannon, senior white house advisor of our great nation, believes in total destruction of government institutions. he is a leninist. there are also multiple speeches available where he claims the us is in the "great fourth turning" of our history. seems that fancy, nonsensical bit of language is a made-up reality that can lead us straight to war. <br/><br/>their work has already broken down our elections, the bedrock of who we are. look at their cabinet picks -- most want to eliminate what they are in charge of in order to weaken and break down our government agency by agency. trump and bannon are making the press the "enemy of the people." they are trying to make us fear our intelligence community. their inroads have been swift. <br/><br/>please shed more light on bannon. give us more on trump's personal lawyer crafting foreign policy re ukraine. the press has improved in calling trump's lies, "lies." now it's time to clearly reveal what kind of destruction he is planning and why. and destruction of our nation it is. <S_SEP> bannon attended harvard, a place for big-brained people. he is trump's rasputin who wants to change the world order.
given the amount of proven lies told by mr. trump just over the last year, i'm going to go out on a limb here and say he's lying about his campaign's contacts with russia.<br/><br/>oh, and i also want him to be compelled to release his tax returns. i understand larry flynt has offered a cool million to anyone who gets them to him.<br/><br/>this whole presidency stinks to high heaven. the rot is tangible, and has to be uncovered. <S_SEP> nicholas mentioned the score of false denials by trump and his aides about their ties to russia. that begs the following question "can an american president be impeached for lying over,and over, again". according to article ii of the constitution, a president can be impeached for "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors". legal scholars are divided over whether or not impeachment must involve a criminal act, or simply "maladministration". in reality an impeachable offense is anything the house of representatives says it is. at what point does the scale of donald trump's unprecedented lying reach the level where it can no longer be tolerated. his malicious charges against barack obama, are polarizing, and indicate an endemic disrespect for the office of the president. what if he made similar false allegations against a foreign leader, lied about the reasons for launching a nuclear attack, invading a country, or misrepresented intelligence information? the time has come for republicans ( they hold the impeachment power in their hands ) to put partisanship aside, and take a long, hard look at trump's veritable avalanche of lies, as well as, his erratic and dysfunctional behavior. the security and well being of the nation may hang in the balance. <S_SEP> your dot #8, trump's financial dealings in russia, should be dot #1 and the starting point for all of this. i agree that sessions is a red herring, except that he is our country's chief law enforcement officer and has already shown himself to be a liar. but the real liar is trump, who swears, "i don't know russia," although there are numerous videos of him there and interviews in which he claims to have met putin. his tax returns are the key to unraveling business ties, but he also needs to be deposed and questioned under oath, just as clinton was by ken starr, about those ties. if he lies, that's grounds for impeachment. as for his 2016 campaign, i agree that manafort is the key. how did he happen to become trump's campaign manager? who recommended him? he is still very much around - the monday after the inauguration, he strode right by me at reagan-national as i was waiting to return home after the women's march. follow the money and follow the managers!
, ukraine's nationalist sentiment, putin's motivation i think putin did think trump could win because he knew the west was ripe for a sort of 'revolution.' i think he understands our weaknesses in a far greater way than we do-namely no real journalists anymore due to job cuts and economic depression denied by the mainstream. i don't think it is a coincidence he was reportedly behind the euro 2016 cup clashes of violence against british fans. i think he was trying to stir up nationalism and bring about brexit. i do agree with brexit but i never liked the idea of the west being weaker in relation to putin. <S_SEP> from the third presidential debate: <br/><br/>trump : now we can talk about putin. i don't know putin. he said nice things about me. if we got along well, that would be good. if russia and the united states got along well and went after isis, that would be good. <br/><br/>he has no respect for her. he has no respect for our president. and i'll tell you what: we're in very serious trouble, because we have a country with tremendous numbers of nuclear warheads -- 1,800, by the way -- where they expanded and we didn't, 1,800 nuclear warheads. and she's playing chicken. look, putin... <br/><br/>wallace: wait, but... <br/><br/>trump: ... from everything i see, has no respect for this person. <br/><br/>clinton: well, that's because he'd rather have a puppet as president of the united states. <br/><br/>trump: no puppet. no puppet. <br/><br/>clinton: and it's pretty clear... <br/><br/>trump: you're the puppet! <br/><br/>clinton: it's pretty clear you won't admit... <br/><br/>trump: no, you're the puppet. <br/><br/>clinton: ... that the russians have engaged in cyberattacks against the united states of america, that you encouraged espionage against our people, that you are willing to spout the putin line, sign up for his wish list, break up nato, do whatever he wants to do, and that you continue to get help from him, because he has a very clear favorite in this race.<br/><br/>=================== <S_SEP> , the big story this analysis helps us keep our eyes on the prize. all the swirling stories and revelations and counter-narratives and commentary in the breathless media end up, often, providing more heat than light. meanwhile, there's no disputing that the president is soft on russia and putin -- none. the big story, as leonhard suggests, is why. let us stick with that. it's a way out of the swamp.
it doesn't matter whether or not you shout at us using capital letters; that doesn't make your assertion about "not a shred of evidence" any more credible. <br/><br/>and are you some kind of magical genie who can predict the future (i.e. "there never will be")? if the evidence exists, we simply haven't found it yet; that doesn't mean that we should stop looking.<br/><br/>and lots of the things that trump (and his "rabid partisan" followers like yourself) have claimed to be "fake news" along the way have in fact been demonstrably true.<br/><br/>you betray your rabid partisanship (and undermine your credibility) when you call mr. kristof a "traitor" simply for asking questions.<br/><br/>you don't seem to be able to handle living in reality without spewing ad hominem attacks. so, go slithering back to faux news, where trolls like you who believe in "alternate facts" and conspiracy theories belong. <S_SEP> mr. kristoff loses all credibility when he equates real life to an obnoxious hbo mini-series.<br/>no wonder this country is in serious trouble. the reporters cant distinguish fantasy from reality. <S_SEP> hey, nick....that "red scare' thing kinda back-fired on ole joe mccarthy. 'member?
this might be less troubling if we had an honest president. instead, we have someone who tells at least one lie every time he speaks in public.<br/><br/>the nsa says trump's campaign staff spoke to the russians during the campaign. the russians say the same thing. only trump insists there was no contact.<br/><br/>if trump wanted to find out if any of this was true he could send someone over to the nsa to review the phone intercepts, and then get the truth from any of his staff identified on the intercepts. instead, we get denial and bluster.<br/><br/>it's time to appoint a special prosecutor to get to the bottom of this murky swamp. <S_SEP> , fbi to have one of trump's advisors be suspected of having contacts with russians would in itself been a scandal. but to have all these people involved and then lying about it only gives more ammunition for the fbi to dig in further. let's hope the fbi or counterintelligence has a mole in russia to help them. i can barely wait to see how this story is going to end up.<br/><br/>further, let trump whine and complain all he wants because nobody believes or cares what he does about this investigation. <S_SEP> it's an interesting dynamic. when trump was elected, it appeared that he had the republican party under his thumb. now, if the party plays its cards right, they have him boxed in and can make him sign anything simply by threatening to open inquiries into the russia issue, dragging it all into the light. same thing in exposing him as either a liar regarding the wiretap charge, or exposing the fisa court allowance of such a tap as legal and thus necessary.
how much longer must we put up with all the childish nonsense from the supposedly president now in office. he's running around the country in campaign mode instead of doing the job he unfortunately won. those of you who voted for him got what you deserved....but.....the rest of us did not deserve what we got. lies, lies, and more lies. i hope president obama sues him! <S_SEP> well, this is pretty much the first time our president has gotten involved in treason. <S_SEP> when will the public humiliation end? he has reduced the usa to a punchline.
the column lays out plenty of evidence to justify an investigation, now supported by an increasing number of americans. read it again. then lay out your evidence for trump's outrageous tweets about wiretapping. <S_SEP> it's not going to backfire. get real the evidence is becoming more and more clear. in fact the obligatory lecture to democrats is a bore we are not like republicans were not conspiracy theorists and in fact i think it's much worse than the author imagens . <S_SEP> yes, remember benghazi...??? there have been 24 attacks on us embassies and consulates since reagan was elected president. reagan had 4 attacks resulting in 70 deaths, bill clinton had 3 attacks with 223 deaths, gw bush had 8 attacks with 48 deaths. anyone remember how many congressional hearings were held over those deaths..??? if you said one, you are correct, only the recent one the gop created to bash hillary... the other 23 went unchallenged…!!! secretary clinton had appeared just a few months before the attack, asking congress for additional funding for security for embassies and outposts. that request was flat out turned down by the gop…!!! then they blamed her for the attack...!!!
trump's continued insistence president obama wiretapped him despite every denial of this by intelligence officials and now the fbi director, comey, publicly is part of his mentor's playbook, the notorious roy cohn. but the longer trump tries to use this to distract the public from what has been called russiagate the more it seems reasonable for his opponents to start chanting, "lock him up! lock him up!" at every opportunity. and judging from the evident weariness and testiness of republicans in congress, it seems impeachment is becoming more and more a real possibility and not just the wishful dream of democrats and all those who loathe him. the 2018 congressional elections could become a great tide that flips the house to the democrats, and the savvier republicans must be thinking about this - the sooner trump is gone from the stage, the better for them. <S_SEP> the single greatest danger of the last month is the republican congress's unwillingness to investigate 45's ties to russia. not knowing what we may be dealing with here is truly dangerous territory for america. voters have put gop representatives and senators in place who generally are putting their party and their power above the interests of our own country. not knowing what we are dealing with in our leader's ties to russia could certainly bring us all down in fairly short order. what will it take to make our congressional leaders do the right thing for the safety of our country? i am not convinced that they will. their interests lie elsewhere. <S_SEP> these leakers are patriots in the fight for our democratic values over budding oligarchs. thank you for taking personal risk to fight for our country! we depend on you.
strongly disagree that nick is off-base in trying to connect dots, or that anyone should care what steve jobs said about when to do so. a) he's dead and b) he was a marketing guru, with no knowledge of government or politics. it is of extreme importance for those in the media to begin making a case and taking it to the american people. as was done with the pentagon papers and watergate, wherein the media and we the people, led elected officials. we cannot wait for a partisan and self-interested congress to connect the dots-- we must begin the process. <S_SEP> thank you for the analogy, mr. kristof.<br/>not being familiar with the show "house of cards", i'm sure it is far more amusing show than what we are seeing now with this presidency -- which is not amusing at all.<br/>in fact, it's rather frightening. starting with the cast, and the inability to turn the show off.<br/>not to mention the "dots". there's lots of those, and invariably little doubt as to where they connect. especially as the distractions that donald trump produces have become more frequent and outrageous.<br/>but if this is a sign that the digging is getting closer to its mark, don't stop now. <S_SEP> it had never crossed my mind but i am with president george w. bush. we need answers.<br/><br/>the dots seem to start with president trump's business with russia and russians as confirmed by donald jr. then at some point, putin owned trump and thought it was safe to have him in the white house.<br/><br/>the rest is operations, including roger stane's sneak preview in tweeter. however, the dots do not end in the white house, they end at the trump family net worth. we are not there yet.
i think it would be useful to know what level of contacts the other presidential candidates maintained with russia and russians as a point of comparison. <S_SEP> follow the russian connections! the rest will fall in place. <S_SEP> the only question you have to ask is: "why was contact by trump operatives made only with russia and no other country?" it would seem that contact with allies would be the most natural first step during a campaign. i haven't seen or heard anyone ask that particular question.
trump's greed, ego and business failures led him to be suckered into being supported by russian money ( son's comments, plus latest evidence--trump/russian collaboration on hotel in toronto--how many more of these around the world?).<br/><br/>and now that he's president, mcconnell etc. are taking advantage of his ignorance, susceptibility to manipulation, and lack of attention span to bend him to their will (it benefits them to not investigate any of this).<br/><br/>these extreme republicans are bent on destroying the us gov--(proof; the cabinet pick's own statements on what they think of the part of gov. they are hired to lead).<br/><br/>so far the only ones with backbones to go against this scourge appear to be mccain, leakers, and the media. so much for patriotism. <S_SEP> we are gently pole-vaulting over an obvious and insidious problem. this administration's efforts so far are perfectly confluent with putin's objectives in the west: erode internal stability, neutralize the effectiveness of departments like state, and erode the u.s. reputation internationally. trump could easily be putin's wrecking-ball against the structure of u.s. government. <S_SEP> i have a simple message today. we need to know the truth behind the russian ties. the future of our country may depend on it.
hey charles - you are the perfect illustration of "the problem." too many people are drinking the trump kool-aide and believe all of the hoo-hah coming from the current administration and faux news. calling for special prosecutors is not some sort of equivalency test - you know that if there was even a smidgen of real or made up evidence, a republican led witch hunt would ensue (ask hillary). <S_SEP> our rep finally had a telephone town hall; his lines were in lockstep with trump; almost sounded like a script he was reading "there are no ties with russia and we will not appoint a special prosecutor because there is nothing there"...etc, etc. it sounded like spicer with a different accent. seems many of them are in on whatever russian deals they are eyeing in those oil fields and they will try to block any and all investigations into the russia ties to the trump campaign. we have had corrupt congressmen before but this is much bigger than that. it will take a village to uncover it all. <S_SEP> if the trump administration has nothing to hide then there is no excuse for not agreeing to a special prosecutor. it will clear the air, everyone can play nice again and all will be well. ...but i don't think so.
a lot lot of times last year, we could not wait for our daily laugh fix from the trump campaign. now we cringe at trump's daily effort to destroy our country. it is like watching the same inevitable train wreck every day. <S_SEP> they say that in moments of crisis, like a car wreck, there is a very real distortion in the perception of the passage of time. everything seems to slow down as the realities of the situation flood in.<br/><br/>is it any wonder the time of trump, now just over 60 days, seems to be lasting forever? <S_SEP> thank you for the outstanding analysis, mr. kristof.<br/><br/>this time, the showers on don the con's parade will not be so golden.
trump truly is behaving like a guy with a screw seriously loose. we've never had a serious loon in the white house. how do we remove him before he blows up the world? that would be truly "sad." <S_SEP> donald's desperation is growing daily. he's just like a cornered and wounded animal. he's running scared and will soon find no place to hide. he will try to do worse before he's finally stopped. cooler heads will have to prevail when his desperation causes him to attempt something catastrophic. are there those that will stop him? let's desperately hope so for everyone's sake. <S_SEP> how do majority of republicans sleep at night? how do you do your job knowing that donak trump is more corrupt than hillary ever thought of being. i have a feeling he will get away with all this and when they decide to wake up or finally do something it'll be too late.. ww3 is already brewing
let the haunting begin. given all the months of speculation and evidence that some kind of russian interference and collusion occured, it's time to stop the procrastination and face the inevitable, whatever that might be.<br/>we, the american people, deserve nothing less. <S_SEP> , discredited opposition candidate, liar in the white house prosecutor or no, meantime the damage has been done. we have a liar in the white house, a discredited opposition candidate maligned beyond redemption, and the very people who created the 2008/09 massive recession now firmly established in top government positions.<br/>how this mess can now be undone is anybody's guess <S_SEP> benghazi was an endless commission that served no practical purpose; however an investigation into the russian connection could potentially have long-term and deleterious effects on our nation's democracy. it must be investigated.
perhaps the media won't be so cowed by a tweet from pence. for despite all their fine reporting after the election,this newspaper and all other media outlets were complicit in electing trump by their failure to report actual news and opted to entertain the public with trump interviews and the televising of every trump campaign speech, even after they were herded into a pen like cattle. they all put profits and ratings ahead of their country. just think if the media had grown a pair and told team trump we won't be covering any more events from a pen, bet things would be different today. <S_SEP> are the distractions that president trump creates by tweets a play to sweep the truth under the table? the latest gallup poll show this works for 37%.<br/><br/>the gallup polls also show the low 30% bar for "watergate nixon", "malaise carter" and "mission accomplished bush" with "tweet trump" not far behind and bringing up the rear. <S_SEP> trump is hoping that the press and the american people will have the same attention span he does; and not stay with this long enough to unravel it. but the press and the american people know this is too important not to get answered. <br/><br/>the gop touts recent polls saying that "90% of the people who voted for trump still support him." just 46% of the voters went for trump. 90% of 46% is 41%. that suggests that the remaining significant majority of voters (59%) are not happy with his performance. elected officials looking for somewhere to hide should consider these true math facts and keep connecting the dots.
mr. kristof,<br/>as far as "connected dots" please include the material rachel maddow discussed in her show on march 7, regarding several details of the christopher steele "uncorroborated" dossier that are now beginning to receive corroboration.<br/><br/>steele, by the way, has emerged from hiding. this weekend i will be writing to the gop chairs and dem vice-chairs of the senate and congressional committees on intelligence, telling them that if they do not attempt to obtain testimony from steele, their efforts to "get at the truth" of a possible trump-russia connection will clearly be nothing but whitewash. <S_SEP> steele's so-called dossier is a joke. anybody, whether trump's republican enemies in the primaries or, later, the dnc, were fools if they paid steele a penny for his schlock. the only people who have given it any credence are frothing liberal media who hope that no one has actually read it. you notice that kristof did not provide a link to the real thing. he probably hasn't read it either. <S_SEP> identifying the dots, let alone connecting them, is our primary concern. this is journalism's bailiwick. the level of trust in congressional and other formal investigations is low. please, along with your colleagues at the nyt and other outlets, continue to publish your findings but be leery of arriving at premature conclusions. our dire situation requires clear and convincing evidence to take or force remedial actions.
if trump's the 'friend of russia' then why is he the one rebuilding and boosting the military? obama was the one cutting the military to it's lowest levels since wwii. we would never have heard a thing about russia had hillary won the election. this is all an attempt to undermine the trump administration. absolutely traitorous! dem's even have moles inside leaking phone conversations and classified information to hurt trump. now the wikileaks that cia hacked and can leave crumbs that implicate that the russians did it. <S_SEP> there are plenty of dots and plenty of ways to connect them that will lead to the obvious conclusion that donald trump and his campaign were assisted by russian government and/or private russian oligarchical interests.<br/><br/>czarists, soviets, and now oligarchs have ruled russia. why should we tolerate for even a moment a president assisted by russia in power in washington? the republican leadership in congress can't believe that their dream-come-true trifecta is too good to be legitimate. rule by a russian puppet harms our laws, traditions and our future. the trump presidency is a blunder on the order of the invasion of iraq. or viet nam. or 9/11. this time the shock and awe have come home to the usa, and we need to shake it off. watergate pales beside this trashing of american democracy. <S_SEP> , incompetence, budget cuts, insanity, trump's ties to russia in any ordinary world, trump's ties to russia would be front and center of my concerns about his presidency. but they seem miniscule at the moment compared to cutting the budgets of important programs to feed the open maw of the pentagon and to build his gilded wall, his encouragement of the congressional insanity on health care, and his utter unwillingness to govern (well maybe we are fortunate that he is incompetent as well as insane). and his answer to all this is more campaign style rallies to get the deplorables out in force again. but judging by the tiny turnouts across the country on worship great leader day, it seems that he is wearing thin on almost everyone who hasn't joined his administration or is even barely sentient.
whether he, or his staff are owned by russia or wish to emulate the oligarchy, they are off to a stunning start. <br/><br/>our spineless and amoral public servants are reprehensible. <br/><br/>good luck and godspeed to the press and their allies. <S_SEP> until trump disproves theories of financial ties to russia he'll be dogged by speculation they exist. he could have easily put this behind him by providing tax returns that put our national suspicions to rest. refusing to so enables us to think the worst: he must have something to hide. it wouldn't be unreasonable to speculate tump's offensive against the mainstream media is a preemptive strike to discredit this developing story before the truth is uncovered by congress or solid investigative reporting. <S_SEP> , russians, tump, iran's revolutionary guard putin helped tump get into the white house. i'm putting my money on putin getting him out. in addition,, check out his relations with azeberjhan's known corrupt official,, who was in partnership with iran's revolutionary guard. his 60 million $ windfall with sale to russian billionaire. not impeachable.(.perhaps?,) but certainly reflects his lack of "due diligence".
trump cozies up to a natural enemy like russia while he insults or alienates nations that have been friends for decades. in addition to australia and others, he has now he has added even sweden to the latter list. he has access to the most vast intelligence community in existence, which he belittles, but relies on fox news as a basis for his erroneous rants. it doesn't get any more stupid than that. <S_SEP> another reason could be trump's narcissism. the mistranslated comment where he believes putin called him 'brilliant' would loom large in trump's mind even though a more accurate translation would be 'colorful'. he loves being the center of attention at all times, continuously bringing up his electoral college victory and having a rally with his supporters in florida less than one month into his administration. <S_SEP> you and rachael maddow should team up, although her dots turned out to be only specks of mud on the wall. how about connecting the dots between bill, hillary, and russia? your comment about "half-a-dozen people in trump's circle" contacting russians is journalistic muckraking in its purest form. what do you consider trump´s circle? business people, political advisors, friends vacationing in st petersburg? i have had 5 or 6 contacts with russians over the past few years. i also know president trump. maybe i am a dot!
the integrity of our homeland is at risk because of possible cyber attacks and collusion by a foreign country on our democratic processes. it is time to rise above partisanship and work together to protect what our founding fathers gave us: the united states constitution and bill of rights.<br/><br/>"...[a] select committee that has subpoena power and a mandate to issue a comprehensive report of its findings" is what the american people must demand. americans have sacrificed their sons and their daughters on the battlefield and will not stand idly by while a foreign country takes over the electoral processes of our great democracy using collusion and computers. <br/><br/>it is time to put country above politics. it's the patriotic thing to do. <S_SEP> "...to safeguard american democracy" is never the objective of trump. his priorities are to safeguard business, his family and himself...in reverse order of importance. <S_SEP> safeguard american democracy? what exactly does that mean after this shallow megalomaniac became president? trump will hasten to embroil the usa in a nuclear conflict with north korea rather than admit that he's stupid or wrong about anything. we are living the hans christian andersen tale of "emperor's new clothes" in a most ironic and unamusing way. the russians studied this freak and decided he would be most instrumental to furthering their policies and so were able to hack into his staff and reprogram his agenda. of course trump will deny everything, including our constitutional rights...
, russia and ukraine war, gas, gazprom, crimea, black sea mark is spot on! its all about gas, black sea, crimea, gazprom, exon-mobil. follow the money, which means follow the oil and gas. everything else is distraction. trump desperately wants to be in the real billionaires club. <S_SEP> i think trump is obsessed with jihadists. trump admires putin's solution to the chechens, which is brutality. add to that the russian "assets" and you have the answer. so simply put its partly the appeal of committing murder in the name of defense and lining his conflict of interest pockets. no democrat could ever have gotten away with what trump is doing. <S_SEP> why isn't oil near the top of this list? didn't the secretary of state have a $400 billion oil deal scotched by obama's sanctions? isn't russia primarily a kleptocracy organized around the expropriation and exploitation of russia's carbon resources for the benefit of putin and his cronies? the us can help russia in the destruction of the global efforts to protect climate. russia can enrich trump and tillerson. this bromance is all about carbon and climate. america's oil states, north dakotastan, texarabaria, saudihoma, west virlibya and iraqasee are all on board to destroy climate for their monetary benefit. weld county in colorado is paying cash for infrastructure because oil is on private land there. utah is piloting the schemes to get public lands into private hands. kleptocracy pure and simple. the confluence of ideology, theft and climatecide. oh, its not warming; and if it is warming, humans are not the cause; and if humans are the cause it won't warm much; and if it does warm a lot, there is nothing we can do about anyway because our conservative politicians are bought and paid for by oil dollars. and finally, by a fluke, they are in power. the koch brothers and trump will have an nice public distance while embracing over oil exploitation in the arctic, pipelines to shale catastrophes and the theft of public lands for their use.<br/>by the way, this is not a victim-less crime. our grandchildren will pay dearly for the destruction of climate for oil profits.
the hacking is the tip of the iceberg. the part below the surface is all about his business dealings which strongly indicate money laundering for and compromise by the russians. <S_SEP> tax returns should be higher on the list.<br/><br/>they are the most likely path to answering whether corruption is involved between the business mogul and the kgb agent who are now presidents of the two most powerful countries on the globe. <S_SEP> wonderful column. thank you. i am counting the days until some patriot in the irs releases trump's tax returns for him. shouldn't be too much longer. since half of them have already been fired by the republican budget-slashers, job security is no longer much of an inhibition to a responsible leaker.
when you look at all of the "dots" and how they align with russia - i would guesstimate that the odds are astronomically against these being benign coincidences.<br/><br/>it's not just the people and their histories - it's the actions, the timing of those actions, and the (currently known) results of those actions, and how they align, in toto, going back to the very beginning of trump's modus operandi. <S_SEP> at this point, seems pretty certain that the dots will connect...all the way to the president. it's just a matter of how many others go down with him. its also fairly certain that any 'investigation' at the political level will move at a snail's pace, if at all. so to all journalist, news reporters and commentators - keep on digging, and searching and connecting those dots - please! do not let this go until we have all the facts! <S_SEP> here's another connection: dasha zhukova, wife of russian industrialist billionaire roman abramovich was ivanka's guest at the inauguration. <br/><br/>abramovich has a long and close relationship with putin. <br/><br/><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_abramovich" title="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_abramovich" target="_blank">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/roman_abramovich</a><br/><br/>trump to putin - apparently only 3 degrees of separation.
it really says something special about the republican party when they cannot be counted on to be impartial when dealing with matters of our arch enemy trying to influence our election results. the republican party is un-american and the proof of it is their members avoiding any questions about russian interference with out election by deflecting attention to this by demanding getting to the bottom of the whistle-blower who outed flynn.<br/><br/>talk about open traitors to their country. <S_SEP> i only want to know one thing, who was general flynn talking to between his calls to the russian ambassador, and what was said? the general has fallen on his ceremonial sword, and he may want to pull it out. put him under oath. <S_SEP> republicans need to be asked what they think about their oath to support and defend the constitution against all enemies, foreign and domestic. if they are not concerned about russian interference in our election, then they are not concerned with upholding their oath and should be removed from office.
march 21, 2017<br/><br/>so far watergate lite - what did dt know and when, where, who and what cyber tech design for the overthrow of natural business as normal to this post obama administration. were we the people is a seditious inference in the hyper face news era and was our election an exercise for the grand master plan for the permanency of the putin - catherine the great exercise of a rebirth for czarist mother russia and in practice with the trump inexperience to beware of the very nature of responsibilities to administer his overthrown of the political class in our great washington establishment. what's next the cyber take over of the elite journals in america and in europe - that indeed produced the britain brexit - oh sure .....<br/><br/>jja manhattan, n. y. <S_SEP> this is why the nyt is worth its weight in gold - careful analysis and appropriate questions rather than the lies, conspiracy and obfuscation of briebart, bannon, spicer and company! <S_SEP> the master class in distraction, deception and obfuscation continues. the republicans decide to focus their wrath on the whistle blowers who have leaked the truth of the administration's misdoings. everyone else wants to know who created the misdoings in the first place.<br/><br/>meanwhile the first daughter moves into her very own west wing office, complete with government-issued phone, and access to classified information, as her father's "eyes and ears." all without any qualification other than the dna connection.<br/><br/>so when the next twitter storm erupts, exactly what will the trump dynasty being distracting us from. emergency police powers for the first daughter? state of emergency to send in the troops to chicago? reinstatement of the draft to fight a new north korean conflict?<br/><br/>all of this should be so improbable, now i fear it's only the beginning.
one explanation that has been put forward for trump's puzzling admiration and deference toward vladimir putin is that he subscribes to the alt-right/white nationalist view that russia is a potential ally against radical islamism (or against islam generally). that raises an interesting question: did russia plant that idea among the alt-right? for that matter, is the american alt-right partly a russian creation? <S_SEP> “…trump merely flirts with the alt-right.” from my vantage point, he is way past flirting and has jumped into bed with those racists and xenophobes. every time i hear dt talk about something that is not himself, it is so easy to picture bannon as the one whispering into his ear. <S_SEP> well, sure. president bannon wants a new crusade against islam, and he's enlisting all of the "judeo christian" (cough, white) nations to fight them. that includes russia, where putin as usual is ahead of the game in exploiting nationalism and orthodox christianity to the hilt. so he tells donny to lay off, donny does what he's told.<br/><br/>do i think this is the whole story? nope, but when you add in the very likely facts nicholas lays out, it adds up. bumpf is already mortgaged to and compromised by the russians, so he's shall we say pre-disposed to cutting them slack. bannon has his reasons. the isolationists have theirs.<br/><br/>but we need to push on trump and his minions. they are easily caught in lies -- flynn, manafort, page, etc. just remember deep throat: "follow the money".
well at least your honest that you want a special prosecutor, not an independent prosecutor as preet is about as far from independent as you can get right now; he has shown that he is first a partisan (and besides, this won't help him get his next gig, a house seat in the us congress) <S_SEP> , new chief of fbi mr. comey has already shown poor judgement in his involvement in helping mr. trump, so a fresh independent investigator would be welcome. i heard there was a great federal attorney with investigative skills who just lost his job in new york, and i know a woman who graduated from wellesley and yale law school with tremendous international experience. they both are hard working dedicated public servants, and they both might be available. <S_SEP> watching the opposition to appoint a special prosecutor is like watching a scene from one of the old tarzan movies where someone steps into quicksand. the harder you struggle to free yourself the faster you sink.
if so, checkmate? i hope that someone with influence is ready to offset the threat of instability. when the dominos fall, 39% of us will still be zealous supporters of trump. the country needs, now, an alt/parallel leader with the grounding spirit of a cronkite. if we are really a nation that governs by the rule of law, there is a massive coil under compression ready to spring, either sooner or later. <S_SEP> it is probably better than the current twitching time bomb who is potus. it hasn't even been three months yet. <S_SEP> it should and it ought but it won't<br/>the trumpian edict is don't<br/>the coverup's failing<br/>the truth should be nailing<br/>the donald but he'd never own't.
trump wants to be emperor of everything - business, money, power, success, the law, the people, the news, the polls, the voting machines. <br/><br/>what better model to turn to than putin. <S_SEP> a true putin puppet. <S_SEP> putin vs. trump is not a contest. putin, as everyone knows,is a<br/>veteran of the kgb, and trump is veteran of the manhattan real<br/>estate wars and the "apprentice". what is obvious is that trump in<br/>not a leader. before trump twitters himself to oblivion,he might<br/>read the "art of war". it's easy, and he can learn from it.
"lock her up"? lock them up, starting at the top! <S_SEP> david, the consistency, indeed lockstep, with which republicans insist on the priority of shooting the messenger reveals that it's not some principled course of action they have each arrived at after long thoughtful consideration. they are under orders to help prop up mr. trump's failing presidency as long as possible in the service of accomplishing a political agenda. possibly a useful short-term strategy, though ultimately at the expense of their reputations as patriotic and decent citizens <S_SEP> 3 words: lock him up!
see "what does it mean to have repeated contacts with russian intelligence?" this article exposes how russian intelligence agents pose as businessmen to gain access.<br/><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/what-does-it-mean-to-have-repeated-contacts-with-russian-intelligence/516843/" title="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/what-does-it-mean-to-have-repeated-contacts-with-russian-intelligence/516843/" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/what-does-it-m...</a> <S_SEP> hmm. russian intelligence officers are known for posing as businessmen to cosy up to leaders and businessmen. see: russian contacts – what it means<br/><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/what-does-it-mean-to-have-repeated-contacts-with-russian-intelligence/516843/" title="https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/what-does-it-mean-to-have-repeated-contacts-with-russian-intelligence/516843/" target="_blank">https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2017/02/what-does-it-m...</a> <S_SEP> just saw this recently - it may or may not help to make this web of intrigue clearer: <a href="https://thetrumpwatchdog.com/2017/02/14/the-path-to-putin/" title="https://thetrumpwatchdog.com/2017/02/14/the-path-to-putin/" target="_blank">https://thetrumpwatchdog.com/2017/02/14/the-path-to-putin/</a>
1. trump will fire comley<br/>2. manaford and stone will fall on the sword.<br/>3. trump will start a war with north korea to detract.<br/>4. rednecks will follow him off a cliff, which is where they are heading <S_SEP> will trump fire comey?<br/>another saturday night massacre? <S_SEP> trump and his gang have really tied down the american people on the train tracks. the people are not waiting to simply watch a train wreck inevitably happen. they are helplessly watching and waiting for the train to kill them. we are in truly dark days!
is trump dumping so badly pence is less and less likely a convincing option? seriously...do you believe him, or is he tarnish by the same shalering of suspicious characters? or is the entire administration a pile of flaming cowpies? if someone doesn't attempt to salvage it soon, can we collect what comes ashore from this ship wreck justly? <S_SEP> if we impeach him we get pens who is also a monster. but we need to do is prove that the election was not legitimate. <S_SEP> simple. the repubs may try to weep it unde the rug, but they won't be able to kep it secret. if the voters are interested they can sweep them out in 2018. if not, they will deserve what they get; and for certain, it won't be america made great again.
since the policy of limiting any comment on 1500 characters, in dividing the previous comment and rushing to post them one after another to have an hopefully continuous reading, i noted, after posting it, that it should have been<br/><br/>"settlements in palestinian territory " instead of "establishments in ...." <S_SEP> i didn't know hawaii was a muslim country. <S_SEP> njglea,<br/>i think that kl probably reads more than you. just a thought
seconding this perceptive acknowledgement, that truth is stranger than fiction. i would like offer another important and thus hopeful aspect of truth.<br/>truth, like light, is sure to shine out the "dark treacherous secrets". <S_SEP> nyt you are wise and wonderful. please keep it up. <S_SEP> i'd just like to say, i think the stories graphic – by 'script and seal', if i'm correct – is fantastic!
where's there's smoke... <br/><br/> keep pressing on through all of trump smokescreens, nyt and washington post. it must feel like you're constantly responding to the small fires on a daily basis, but stay the course.<br/><br/>you found the big fires before and put them out. our country needs you now to do the same. <S_SEP> there is too much smoke not to be a fire somewhere. support quality journalism. those journalists are the fire department. <S_SEP> are you sitting in a lonely dark room with a lit cigarette creating smoke? that's the best you've got? too many ifs.
it's amusing that people believe trump has a political ideology. as has been stated many time he is a "transactional" guy. the only common theme in trump's life has been money. his connections with russia are based on money. <S_SEP> in 2008 donald trump, jr. said, "russians make up a pretty disproportionate cross-section of a lot of our assets. we see a lot of money pouring in from russia." follow the money.
you're correct, nick. this is the issue of trump's tenure. congressional republicans - the majority - and the justice dept deputy are too close to trump to doggedly investigate. it is up to the media to dig and beat this drum. reminds me of watergate. <S_SEP> isn't it rather ironic that james comey, who improperly meddled in the election, is now investigating whether others did the same?
you are jumping to conclusions. no proof of collusion has been revealed or collected, and an investigation means nothing until its results are produced. don't jump the gun here. furthermore, given the recently leaked capability of the cia and nsa to leave the footprints of other intelligence agencies to redirect blame, no one can now say that the russians were the ones who hacked the democratic party, at all. <S_SEP> lacking evidence, suspicions are assumed to be motives. <br/><br/>then russia is blamed for things that have causes right here at home.<br/><br/>russia did not steal that election. hillary lost it. she said herself that she should have been far ahead. why wasn't she? it was not putin, it was her.<br/><br/>the same is true in syria. yes, putin intervened. he came late to a long war fed by western money. <br/><br/>western money and weapons were given to jihadi crazies like the one who met with sen mccain, and soon after stared in a video in which he cut out the innards of a prisoner and ate them on video still raw and still body temperature. "head choppers" r us. that was not done to us by putin either. we made that reality, to which he came late. <br/><br/>blame on putin avoids facing our own mistakes. that avoids fixing them. that enables doing the same mistakes again and again. and we have.
the suspicion alone of hrt communicating with russians would have had republicans screaming conspiracy. why can't democrats start screaming, "lock him up?" <S_SEP> for over 12 months now, ordinary people in the democracies of the world have been staggered by the brazen lies of donald trump on every single american or international issue. people all over the free world have also been shocked by the willingness, even eagerness, of the american press to hedge &amp; fudge the so-called president's lies as 'unsubstantiated', 'no evidence', 'untruths' etc. americans now have to endure for 4 years - maybe even 8 years - the national shame of having elected a president who is a permanent liar, reviled by the free world.
i remain quite naive in my old age, have to admit it, but this trump drama with the contagious russian tentacles and connections is unbearable and unbelievable. the congress, run by the g.o.p., wants to protect trump no matter what. how can anyone at this point not connect the dots of collusion? what percentage of congressional republicans will honor their pledge to uphold the constitution? a meager few, would be my guess, party and power over country. they will sell out the country to keep in power a mentally ill man who knows nothing about the job he holds and who is, quite likely, compromised by vladimir putin, he and his, rotten to the core, caste of fellow travelers. <S_SEP> yes, we are getting close. trump's criminality cannot go unpunished when the forthcoming facts leave no doubt about russia's collusion with trump, so the latter could assault the presidency. john lewis put it best, by not accepting trump as the legitimate head of state; even if one could ignore putin/comey/weiner's dastardly sordid influence, the constant lying of trump to misinformed, and at times prejudiced, folks, making it the 'gospel truth', made it possible the stealing of the white house. but i digress. in spite of the planted distractions of despicable trump, we cannot allow the ball dropped from his russian's connections and likely dependency. either way, trump's unscrupulousness demands justice, and the full weight of the law; thus far, he seems to be above it, breaking it with 'satisfying' regularity (an outrage).
, sandra day o'connor a blue ribbon commission with the likes of sandra day o'connor, charles schwartz, elizabeth warren and al frankenstein should take the lead and find out what happened. <S_SEP> rachel maddow is coming closest to uncovering things, i think. we'll see.
you better believe he has. any cursory read of the rachel maddow show about the king of fertilizer parking his money in an a gaudy florida mansion trump bought seemingly for no reason at all except to have it on hand when an oligarch needed it (overpaying, naturally) to avoid paying an ex-wife more will tell you the tentacles of russian money laundering run deep in trump properties.<br/><br/>every night there is a new disclosure. i'd venture to say maddow's staff is turning up more stuff than any member of our own ic community, and it's becoming a nightly "series" too important to miss. <S_SEP> one important sign that mr. kristoff has missed was highlighted last night (wed, march 9) by rachel maddow on msnbc. that is the extremely odd and uncharacteristic behavior of now secretary of state tillerson. at least eight of the top, long-serving staff of the department have been summarily fired and not replaced. not only has tillerson not made any significant announcements (excepting his irrelevant, pro forma internal welcome to the department), he has been astonishingly absent--sometimes whereabouts unknown--at important international policy meetings in europe recently. all of this would be entirely congruent with a direct effort to degrade the "presence" and influence of the us state department in international affairs--something certainly at, or very near the top of putins overarching wish list. that particularly in light of hillary clinton's putin-political stability-threatening earlier speech publicly highlighting the clear lack of legitimacy of putin's own most recent "election. as maddow repeatedly observes, watch what the trump cadre is doing, *not* what they're saying! the above should strongly prompt an *independent* investigation of possible collusion between russians and members of his campaign team, including trump, himself. steele's memo used the actual collusion-felony words "in return" when describing what appears a "deal" to provide help to the trump campaign in a quid pro quo for removing help for anti-russian forces in ukraine from the party platform.
i may be speaking prematurely and i am probably speaking the obvious, but if definitive proof is found of trump-russia collusion, his election should be nullified and a new one held.<br/><br/>to quote john lennon, "you may say i'm a dreamer, but i'm not the only one". <S_SEP> it can in no way be assumed that just because trump hates the idea of an independent prosecutor, that means he is guilty of anything. the guy is pathologically incapable of cooperating with anyone or anything. (this in turn is the only thing that makes me think maybe he's not guilty of collusion with russia.)<br/><br/>by all means, though, appoint one. it would be insane not to investigate, which is why the only person who is saying that we shouldn't is an insane person.
i agree with this article but also believe there are far more dots to connect than just the ones listed here.<br/><br/>this is an article that must be read to the end because the authors best point is his last. the recent lashing out via twitter and the degree to which djt is attempting to distract is clearly escalating- all telltale signs that we are getting closer to the truth. <S_SEP> well said: "connecting the dots" at this time is pure speculation and is rightly interpreted as part of a partisan political agenda which must be scrupulously avoided if we are to have confidence in the result."
it amazes me that democratic liberals keep referring to trump and the russians as having stolen the election. they just can't accept the fact that clinton ran a bad campaign, never really embraced the sanders wing of the party and relied on a statistically driven group of advisors who thought they knew everything.<br/><br/>clinton lost michigan by roughly 10,000 votes. but when she campaigned there she never went to a single uaw union hall. she lost the election by about 50,000 total votes from pennsylvania, michigan and wisconsin. the number of registered democrats from those states who didn't vote at all is more than twice that number.<br/><br/>the wikileaks emails may have turned off some voters, but even the clinton campaign admits that comey's false investigation probably did far more damage than the emails.<br/><br/>the vaunted russian bear that democrats are so excised about has a crippled economy less than one tenth the size of our, military expenditures around sixty billion, compared to our 700 billion, no and an army basically organized as a home defense force.<br/><br/>cyber wars not withstanding, this drumbeat of the russian threat is mostly myth. so why was trump cozying up to putin? to try and split the growing russia-china economic alliance and take obama's asian pivot to the next level. china is trump's target, for now, not russia. <S_SEP> when i read the paranoid psychobabel in the above responses i cannot help but think how foolish they should all feel if all government investigations fail to find a trump-russian connection.<br/>or will they ?<br/>no probably not. the liberal left still cannot get over that hrc lost the election not because of any foreign meddling but rather because their candidate was perceived as significantly more flawed . remember the 30,000 deleted emails? (a little right wing paranoia here?). remember her failed 'reset' with russia. how about her coming under 'sniper fire' at a middle east airport ,or her coverup of the benghazi attack to the american public ?<br/>for the last eight years the american middle and lower class has born the burden of the liberal agenda . think drug trafficking along the southern boarder, think deteriorating inner urban cities,think a corrupt ,bureaucratic failing school system, think murder rates that make inner cities death zones that have been governed by largely dnc appointees, think sanctuary cities. are you getting the picture?<br/><br/>all the above paid for by hard working middle class dollars. what have they gotten over the last eight years ?<br/><br/>jobs that continue to leave the country, transgender bathroom rights , pc rhetoric,an an inability to save for retirement.<br/><br/>nice going dnc !!!!<br/><br/>i was just reading an article in today's nyt's urging the dnc to move even further left . really ??<br/><br/>lost the election because of the russians. really ???
every time i see a mention of trump's tax returns, i get crazy. we know the 2015 returns are under audit. i assume the 2016 returns are also unavailable since they are not due until 4/15/2017. what about the returns from 2006 through 2014? all under audit? past new presidents have often provided 10 years of returns during their campaigns. what makes me crazy is i have never seen or heard a reporter ask trump or his minions if those previous years are also under audit. if the answer is no, let's see them. if the answer is yes, what the hell is going on? the next stop for the astute reporter is the director of the irs. the first question for john koskinen is, "how in god's name do you have 10 years of an american citizen's under audit with no results?" next question is, "how many other citizens have a decades worth returns under audit?" the ny times has great columnists and i may of missed piece where the above scenario was discussed. if so, please refer me to that article and i'll shut up. <S_SEP> we need a watergate type investigation by a special prosecutor and congress. nothing less is acceptable!
whenever there is a great pot of money, there is trouble. when companies have a great deal of reserves, say for pensions, arbitrage rolls in and the fund is either vastly depleted, or vanishes. the 2008 crash was similar, in that financiers made their money up front, and then got out, creating new mechanisms to hide what they were really doing.<br/><br/>russia's oil is that huge pot of money. and, the republicans and trump administration appear to be doing their best to get their hands all oily with this. as far as trump's taxes, it should be no surprise as to what is in there. his history of getting his products, and fees, up front, getting out better off, and leaving behind chaos is superbly documented. the little guy takes the fall. this time, it will be all the rest of us. <S_SEP> "...wealthy russian oligarchs paid trump tens of millions of dollars more than the properties were worth. "<br/><br/>i am curious if this is common knowledge or where you have read your statement, particularly this part.
it would be absolutely silly to think that jefferson beauregard session iii would do the right (no pun intended) thing and name a special prosecutor to handle the highly sensitive investigation of collusion between the russkies and the trumprades. <S_SEP> appointing an independent special prosecutor would require mr. rosenstein to put country before party.<br/>that would make him unique in the gop establishment and i am not holding my breath.
i am as anti-trump as you can get. so i welcome the news that the fbi is indeed investigating the trump campaign team and that, so far, the assertions that the campaign was somehow bugged by the obama administration, the british, and anyone else is being routinely debunked. but make no mistake, the rhetoricians and pundits who support trump will divert attention to the criminality of those who leak 'classified' information so that everyone will go on a snipe hunt to find them. and in doing so, real issues of the world will go unnoticed.<br/><br/>also, the blowback from all of this will look something like, 'ha ha, you lost so this is just a bunch of sour grapes on your part.' well, for my part, it's not: clinton was a lousy candidate with a boring platform at best, and a corrupt candidate with a tone-deaf platform at worst--she deserved to lose those states that she ignored. <br/><br/>also noteworthy here is this: the russian meddling in the campaign was nothing more than disinformation (propaganda--something that they're very good at) and hacking computer servers (ditto) but ends there. all of this means that the lies and stolen information may have swayed voters, but they did nothing to change the voting tallies. <br/><br/>and this kind of stuff has been going on at least since athens in the fifth century b.c. <S_SEP> disturbing indeed that this investigation will have to somehow shine a light on the truth through the fog of lies this white house occupant has already generated and will keep generating as long as he is there. will this investigation be enough? will an independent investigation team be required? how long will it take for the truth to come out and what will be the ramifications to our nation? <br/><br/>what disturbs me even more is that we have a damaged, defensive, and dysfunctional administration right out of the gate. the rest of the world is watching, either with trepidation or with designs on how to take advantage of this situation. how did america come to this?
about those "unexplained communications between a trump organization computer server and russia’s alfa bank"--isn't it interesting that the other organization receiving communications, albeit a small percentage of them, from the trump tower server was a server belonging to michigan-based spectrum health. the reason it's interesting is that richard devos, husband of the new secretary of education, is the current chairman of the board of directors for spectrum health system. well, i found it interesting, but apparently the fbi didn't and accepted spectrum health's statement that all they received was a small number of spam marketing emails for trump hotels. <S_SEP> regarding point #3: the “unexplained communications” from alfa bank weren’t just communicating with trump’s server, but during the same time there was also a small amount of data exchanged with a server owned by spectrum health in michigan. dick devos (the education secretary’s husband) is chairman of the board for spectrum health. what innocent explanation is there for that coincidence?
, russia and u.s. election as a young teenage boy, i remember vividly to this day standing in the back of the room with my mother and brothers during the testimony of john dean to the watergate commission. yes, those hearings were open to the public and televised all day long on the major networks. there was a time in this country when the concern of every republican and democrat over the rule of law, essentially what was clearly right and wrong, trumped party politics and the lust for power.<br/><br/>today there is a completely different ethos in washington and about the country. achieving and sustaining political power, it seems, is all that genuinely matters to republicans. this is truly a seminal moment in american history. as the editorial board suggests, a bipartisan independent commission with subpoena powers, is the only way this matter can be thoroughly investigated and the truth revealed to the american public. anything short of that, i am afraid, will not reveal the truth. there is a wealth of substantial evidence which strongly suggests wrongdoing on the part of trump and his campaign to undermine the foundation of our democracy - free and fair elections.<br/><br/>if donald trump and the republicans succeed in avoiding a thorough investigation and there was collusion with a hostile foreign government to win the election, then the further demise of america is not in question - it is an absolute certainty. <br/><br/>this is the most perilous moment in american history. <S_SEP> , gop the post-1972 election watergate investigation occurred only because the democrats had strong post-vietnam majorities. if the gop had power in both houses of congress, watergate would have been thrown out with the trash on friday.<br/><br/>i fear this is what will happen this year: these traitors will get away scot free, mixed with breitbart-built fake news and continuous trump feints and rallies.<br/><br/>i hope i am wrong.
, russian sympathizer in the white house republicans put their party first, the country and it's people second. they are condoning a russian sympathizer in the white house. by default, this is indeed treason, pure and simple. a day of reckoning is fast approaching. will the constitution prevail or will trump and his tainted russian loving hacks? we shall see. <S_SEP> republicans,<br/><br/>this guy is a dope and a national embarrassment. remove him before he wrecks the country.
this, and mr. leonhardt's comment, should be made available, at no cost, to every single newspaper in the united states. both should be printed on page 1, above the fold, every day. they should have the same authority and force as a papal bull. perhaps, but only perhaps, can the world exorcise trump satan from the body healthy. <S_SEP> and i heard one of his supporters say, "he wouldn't tweet something if it weren't true!! he's the president of the united states! if he tweets it, it's true!!" heaven help us all!
not a shred of evidence? then no problem with an investigation. <S_SEP> , iraq war, refugees special prosecutors don't always find you think is there, editorial board.<br/><br/>watch what you ask for. <br/><br/>you may get something entirely different. <br/><br/>the last special prosecutor was supposed to investigate "illegal" whitewater land deals. after years of expensive investigations, he found nothing. <br/><br/>then, because he didn't want to look impotent (pun intended), he decided to extend his brief (pun intended) to presidential blowjobs. <br/><br/>he proceed to engross the nation and the world in a prurient spectacle for two years. his final report, true to this special prosecutor's character, was written as pornography for puritans. <br/><br/>meanwhile a guy in a cave in afghanistan was plotting 9/11. the cia had the passport photo of one of the hijackers in january 2001, and photographed him and his buddies plotting the attack in kuala lumpur, malaysia. the cia did not bother to inform their rivals in the fbi, who were busy rejecting a request from colleen rowley for a fisa warrant to open the laptop of the 20th hijacker. <br/><br/>george w. bush, sitting in his mancave in texas, derided the cia briefer who told him in august 2001 about the coming attack. <br/><br/>result: the cheney-inspired rise of the us national security "deep state," war in iraq, 4,000 dead americans, 3 trillion spent by us, the emergence of an islamic state in syria, 500,00 dead syrians, a flood of two million refugees into europe, the bubbling up of populism worldwide, and the election of donald trump.
"there is no reason to doubt mr. comey's commitment."<br/><br/>really? isn't it rather ironic that james comey, who improperly meddled in the election, is now investigating whether others did the same? <S_SEP> firing comey now would be akin to the saturday night massacre. go ahead. make my day.
right now congress is complicit in preventing a full independent investigation. meanwhile this corrupt regime is currently destroying government agencies it have been assigned to run.<br/><br/>the epa is being dismantled while protective standards are shut down. the department of education has been privatized, creating dire consequences for millions of school children. and our state department has become mute while this administration builds an already bloated military budget towards a nuclear world war.<br/><br/>if congress fails to investigate, then it is up to the people to stop them. <S_SEP> we need a whistle-blower protection program independent of the government.
trump lost the popular election by 11 million votes. he won the electoral college by only 50,000 votes in three states. cybersecurity experts say russia was able to hack into enough voting machines to steal the election for trump. <br/><br/>if this is true, trump is guilty of treason and belongs in prison. <S_SEP> it's in the gop genes. nixon, reagan/bush, and now trump interfered before their elections in vietnam, the iran hostage crisis, and now russia.<br/><br/>the gop can't win legitimately. lying and voter suppression matter!<br/><br/>they will do anything to win, even become traitors.
and if trump is indeed the puppet of bannon, miller, et al, we need to know that. trump is probably not be the only crook. <S_SEP> my esteemed other brother richard:<br/><br/>i'm curious what kevin thinks the articles would be that the house might impeach trump on yet not get enough votes in truth to do more than yugely amuse ryan and trump. maybe ... the high crime and misdemeanor of bad hair. or ... not being barack obama -- that's the ticket!
"those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it."<br/>-george santayana<br/><br/>do these people not remember watergate? it was not the break-in but the cover-up that caused their downfall.<br/><br/>it took almost 2 years for watergate to unfold and nixon to resign. hopefully these people will be gone a lot sooner. <S_SEP> trumps tweets reek of nixon's "i'm not a crook".

, bank of cypress, russian oligarch, trump two other dots that deserve to be included in this list: 1) trump bought a notoriously garish palm beach mansion for $40 million, then sold it to a russian oligarch looking for a place to hide money from his ex-wife for $100 million. neither man ever lived in the house, the russian never actually saw it. 2) wilber ross, the billionaire and our new secretary of commerce, was until recently a director of the bank of cypress, the well-known favorite of the russian oligarchs for laundering their money. <S_SEP> , russian fertilizer king rybolovlev follow the money. the russian fertilizer king rybolovlev paid trump $100 million for a florida mansion trump had purchased for $40 million. where did the excess $60 million go? this is a classic money laundering move. some of the money may have been paid back by trump organization to a shell corporation owned by rybolovlev. just saying...
i've believed from the beginning that trump ran to enrich himself and his family. and i also believe that this unhinged president with a history of unethical behavior admires putin not only because he sees him as a strong leader but because putin is now the richest man in the world. and why is putin the richest man in the world? because he stole from his own people. <S_SEP> trump sees a kindred soul in putin: an amoral, opportunistic, power-hungry and manipulative demagogue. his narcissism, of course, prevents him from seeing the inevitable clash of egos - he cannot imagine how the love could not be mutual.
nice try. did you learn that diversionary tactic from trump? <S_SEP> incredible! thanks rick. if you haven't you should read david cay johnston's book on trump.
so it is treason, cruel and foul. trump will be tried and found guilty. he should be hung by his neck until dead.<br/>the presidential election of 2016 will be declared null and void. america will need to go through a new election. trump sold his office before he got it. wikileaks publication was one of the payments. destruction of the state department may well be another. trump is done because he is a traitor to the united states of america and to the american people. the evidence is coming in, fast and furious. he should confess and resign. but he cannot save himself.<br/>cry havoc in the streets. <S_SEP> , russia and wikileaks, emasculate the intelligence agencies number 11 ... new wikileaks dump of cia information ... trump will use this latest assist from assange/russia to emasculate the intelligence agencies and kill the investigations ... we had better be vigilant
"he did not make an issue of russia’s invasion of ukraine during the campaign." trump did make only one change to the republican platform: to weaken support for ukraine. <S_SEP> more importantly, why was the issue of us support of ukraine the only plank in the platform that trump's representatives seemed to care about? they argued for nothing else - not to remove, add, or amend any other part of the platform.
oh i feel sure all of us have been getting spam from russia's alfa bank, right? <S_SEP> and on top of all this ivanka gets security clearance and an office in the white house? clear the lot of them out.
comey will "follow the facts"? when? he hasn't presented one yet. <S_SEP> oil going down. stocks going down. dollar going down. bonds going up.<br/><br/>seems like the stock market recognizes the danger heralded by comey's testimony yesterday.<br/><br/>follow the money! heed the money-managers' wisdom.
in terms of connecting the russian dots, this commentary by rachel maddow sought to explain the puzzling decimation of the state department, and scared the living daylights out of me. and i am about as far from being a tinfoil conspiracist as you could find. <a href="https://youtu.be/fzyjebmhlpm" title="https://youtu.be/fzyjebmhlpm" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/fzyjebmhlpm</a> <S_SEP> nick, we need the tax returns. they will either confirm or dispute that fake 45 is operating on behalf of his pocketbook. i think we know the answer. fake 45 is not a patriot; he is a user of people and things. putin can provide him cash which fake desperately needs ergo he will lighten putin's load. three dots - money - russian - fake 45. follow the money....
i agree completely with your analysis. when trump started saying things like "i know more than the generals do" bannon and putin saw a man ripe for the picking.<br/>little knowledge, no moral compass and greedy. trump was their opportunity.<br/>i would be interested to know who introduced bannon to trump. was it paul manafort? roger stone? the coincidence? that at the time when russia would need sanctions removed and thus manafort &amp; tillerson then bannon coming in for political ideology pro-russian is suspect. <S_SEP> that "private dossier" everyone is so quick to dismiss stated trumps' personal lawyer made numerous trips to and had contacts with russian operatives (which he denied by tweeting the cover of his passport). it now turns out, his personal lawyer is involved with pro moscow ukrainians trying to get a putin approved "peace" deal directly to trump. don't discount that "dossier" which also included trump compromised by russian intelligence.
can we trade this president in for a new one? it seems clear to me that the whole sorry bunch seemed way over there heads way before the election even happened. <S_SEP> , scotus foolish? wasn't it the g20 nations who just changed their tune to align with our position on trade?<br/>while the american press attempts to portray the situation as desperate mr. trump steadily implements his campaign promises.<br/>the fact is he was elected to change our government. sound familiar? after the eight years of obama people, other than the liberal progressives in the government and press and their financiers, were unhappy with what went on and the changes obama made. they wanted to undo his disastrous policies at home and his neglect of foreign policy. they also knew if hillary were elected those policies would continue, the scotus would continue to legislate and america would go further into socialism and unconscionable pc enforcement.
"most republicans want to keep the focus on leaks of classified information."<br/><br/>party before country, as per usual. at this point and as far as i'm concerned, they're traitors, the whole stinking lot of them. <S_SEP> the view of the house intelligence republican leadership is that the crimes are not the problem; the problem is the snitches.
director comey is a g-man surely but he is also a republican as are many on his staff. having watched the devistating investigation of hrc moments before final votes there are zero reasons to believe that he is flawless and unbiased. he should come forward and recommend a special, independent appointment or elsewise democracy will continue to be hurt. similarily, gorsuch should standup and say i cannot be a party to my appointment because i got here by stepping on the most important tenets in the us constitution. he should demand that obama's appointment is confirmed (as should every judge in the country). <S_SEP> what say you now, comey???? mr. integrity, indeed.
when you actually have proof, that's when you start an investigation. to do otherwise is a political stunt worthy of a police/authoritarian state.<br/><br/>and for the nyt and the mainstream media to breathlessly cover news of nothing but innuendos, and write endless "what if" editorials and op-ed in addition, shows the lack of balance and concern for the process, the constitutional issues of prosecution with no evidence, and the naked hate that lives at the nyt and msm for this administration.<br/><br/>i was going to give you another chance but i'm cancelling my subscription. you've devolved into a gossip rag at this point. <S_SEP> your last sentence cuts to the chase. we need someone to leak trump's tax returns. they will almost certainly expose a multitude of sins and help bring down this alien administration. calling all leakers.
i hope you're wrong in your "guess" that there was no collusion, only knowledge, between trump's campaign and russia. with ryan and mcconnel in charge it will take outright traitorous proof to get this demented man out of office. <S_SEP> , russians' hacking of clinton's emails did not mr trump, during a campaign speech, encourage the russians to hack and dumpd information about clinton's emails? isn't that collusion?
the thugs in washington and at the nyt want war with russia. they are not after trump but russia. how dare that country be powerful and thwart the<br/>u.s.'s thrust for world domination? we will go to war with russia based on lies as we did in iraq. how many millions will die? <S_SEP> like when putin started bombing us-backed rebels in syria--that's also definitely the u.s.'s fault (with no blame for russia)?
thomason: complete and utter nonsense. the accusations directed at hillary were not leaks. they were baseless accusations--lies, really--made up by radical right wing liars and trotted out by conspiracy theorists to discredit her. the "source" was right-wing conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>the revelations coming out about the connections between the trump campaign and russia have more than enough merit to warrant major fbi and congressional investigations. it is only through true leaks that we know anything about them. and the fact that so many members of trump's campaign spent so much time talking with the russians when they should have been concentrating on the election, and felt it necessary to lie about it later is more than suggestive.<br/><br/>i get really tired of the false equivalency that tries to justify republican misdeeds by projecting those misdeeds onto democrats. <S_SEP> , russia and trump election meddling there exists a person with certain knowledge and evidence of the trump capaign's collusion with russian assets to undermine the decision making of american voters through extreme false news and other means targeting the reputation and public impression of hillary clinton to a negative bent her campaign could not overcome. for the sake of american democracy and future democracies, this person, or persons, needs to find the courage to come forward. for the future integrity and faith in the integrity of the american electoral process, please come forward.
how much longer is comey going to allow trump to destroy this country before lowering the boom? we are becoming more and more isolated from our allies and threatening war with north korea. how does china react? what happens to an isolated united states when both russia and china are against us? <S_SEP> will destroying trump (if you even achieve it) be a solution? the world and america were a mess before trump even declared his candidacy.<br/><br/>to those who think that the world was just fine in 2014, i would like to ask "what are you smoking?"<br/><br/>trump may not be the solution but i do not have much respect for those who think that there were no problems to be solved.
unless massive troops are moving across this continent, locked in mortal combat with each other, there will be no recognition in either the press or public that we are in a civil war. but we are. this is not longer the usual left/right political game we grew up with. <br/><br/>the republicans are aggressively colluding with the russian oligarchy to mutate the united states government into an absolute plutocracy that, for the sake of corporate profit, will turn a blind eye to russian expansionism. russia also has a well-documented history of white-nationalist fascism that partners well with trump-bannon's racial agenda. <br/><br/>republicans have been working toward this result of this for decades, but it appears that democrats are just beginning to rub their sleepy eyes and wake up to the "carnage" enacted upon democracy. this war predates the current media clown in the white house and has been building up for decades. <br/><br/>patronizing bromides to "give trump a chance" are reminiscent of the business-as-usual attitude that prevailed in europe in the 1930s. this is not a time to wait and see what happens because by then it will be too late. we know exactly what is going on and if we do not stop it no one else will. <br/><br/>my austrian grandmother recalled listening to you know who on the radio in the early 1930s, "he would scream and scream! ugh! but we never actually took him seriously." he was just another media clown. <S_SEP> i firmly believe that it is going to be up to the press to dig out the truth. the current holders of the reigns of power have no motivation what so ever to do the right thing by our country and it's citizens. the unwillingness to aggressively get all of the answers after the show that was put on to keep hrc out of power is egregious. this needs to be shouted from the roof tops and the answers need to be found. the press needs to protect us. it appears that you are the only ones with any means and willingness to do so now. the dems are toothless due to the republican's fixing the game. find the answers and please call out the repubs lack of patriotism every day. the lack patriotism on their it is not an opinion. repub actions and lack thereof, are glaring examples of it and clearly shows their willingness to let our republic fail. our leadership is rotten to the core.
unhinged is the perfect word to describe trump. notice he is looking older by the day, the stress of so many lies must be starting to get to him. never let up! <S_SEP> the more trump is cornered, the more "unhinged" he will become. i hope somebody in his circle with some kind of sanity will hold him down when he loses it because he is a terrifying loose cannon.
the russian conspiracy theory is essentially that the russians hacked the dnc e-mail and released the e-mails to the public and by doing so, influenced the election.<br/>only a reckless and irresponsible individual would put potentially compromising comments in an e-mail that could be hacked by the russians,the chinese, wikileaks, any other country, and any hacker in the world including high school kids. <S_SEP> wow, so now everyone in america is infected with the conspiracy-theory virus--even people i thought were rational. as a trial lawyer i have always adhered to the saying "don't look for a conspiracy when usual human stupidity is the cause." the stupidity here was not having a robust anti-hacking team at the dnc, and having the brains not to click on strange e-mails. sorry, but sometimes circumstances conspire (pun intended) to choose the winner and loser. hillary is just unlucky. oh, and lee harvey oswald acted alone. <br/><br/>as with the assassination of jfk, it is difficult for the worshippers of hillary the god to comprehend how she could be laid low by anything but a grand conspiracy, replete with spies and international intrigue, rather than the mere carelessness of the dnc and podesta's click-itis.
molasses have been known to explode, on a hot day, with enough pressure. <S_SEP> thank you for this editorial.<br/>in all seriousness, where is the line between treason and business "deals," with hostile governments, in opposition against federal policies (e.g. sanctions)?
as my italian nona used to say, "il diavolo fa le pentole e non i coperchi’, which translated means ‘the devil makes pots, and not lids’. so out of trump's boiling pot the truth is escaping and there is no lid to hold it in the pot. <S_SEP> unfortunately pragmatism trumps principles. those who continue to support donald trump and the thoroughly corrupt french presidential candidate françois fillon implore their critics to focus on their respective nation's priorities -- making america 'great' again and sorting out france's debt problems-- over the basic decency and fairness of these two men. a formula for injustice and entrenched corruption for décades to come, should citizens of traditionally democratic republics tolerate this form of laxism incarnated by trump's undignified and inefficient presidency today.
and i would help. helping the russians defeat a socialist, what a sell out! <S_SEP> dude, my money is on the existence of a videotape. <br/><br/>one where he was filmed doing unimaginable, despicable things. <br/><br/>in short, being himself. <br/><br/>so much so, that he'd lose his business, his family, and his freedom all in one fell swoop. <br/><br/>his adulation of putin has a trembling quality to it.<br/><br/>we should end his misery.
it beggars belief that republicans, through inaction, would choose to protect their individual incumbencies as representatives and senators over protection of the nation from foreign interference and meddling in elections and the process of government itself. does it get any less american than that? there can be no reason other than self-interest for their lack of will to pursue the truth through a special prosecutor regarding this deeply troubling series of events. we have a right to know everything about this president, this so called leader of ours, how he got there, who helped him and to whom is he beholden. as the editorial makes clear - what's the risk if there's nothing to hide?<br/>for the record - i am a us citizen resident abroad. <S_SEP> it's really a rare example of extra-territorial loyalty on the part of a us national, also now the first citizen, that for purely selfish motives of gaining power and wealth not only could he make himself vulnerable to the blackmail of an estranged foreign power but also expose the national security of the us to foreign threats and manipulations.
thank you, new york times for clarifying that the only sane, sensible, safe way for our country to proceed is to investigate this entire set of issues in a nonpolitical way that is above suspicion and beyond reproach. it needs to be out of the trump administration's hands and in the hands of a special prosecutor immediately. the future of our country depends on it.<br/><br/> i've lived through the kennedy assassinations, the king assassination, vietnam, watergate, iran-contra, the clinton impeachment, the hanging chads of the bush-gore election, 9/11, and the long recession just ended, and i have never felt this insecure. the rule of law in this country is at stake. no effort is too great to ensure that our integrity as a country has not been compromised. <S_SEP> the donald trump who did nothing wrong and yearns to be viewed as the legitimate president would wholeheartedly support a full and public investigation. the fact that his team is throwing up roadblocks, and he's thorough fits, suggests strongly that this won't happen.
i guess if you really don't care even about the appearance of running an above-board operation, you might do something like this:<br/>the meeting of nato foreign ministers is scheduled for april 5-6...but, according to reuters, sec. tillerson isn't going...but he will be traveling to russia instead! so what's the plan: get as much dirty dealing done as possible before the house of cards collapses? it just seems to be all too much.<br/><a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/tillerson-plans-to-skip-nato-meeting-visit-russia-in-april-us-officials/article34359428/" title="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/tillerson-plans-to-skip-nato-meeting-visit-russia-in-april-us-officials/article34359428/" target="_blank">http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/tillerson-plans-to-skip-nato-m...</a> <S_SEP> trump, i'm sure, is contemplating dropping a bomb on north korea's nuclear installations. nobody would care any longer about his connections with the russians, if an all out war broke out in korea. maybe tillerson is flying to moscow next month to get assurances from putin that the russians won't aid kimmy if and when b-2's start dropping tactical nuclear warheads on kimmy's military infrastructure. some of our generals can't wait. they assure trump<br/>that it will be a "piece of cake"!
i'd like to think most people are ideologically against treason.<br/><br/>g.w. bush left president obama two senseless wars and the great recession. i wouldn't call that a smooth transition.<br/><br/>trump and co. refused the help the obama administration offered.<br/><br/>time to get a clue. <S_SEP> interesting that leonhardt doesn't acknowledge the murderous foreign policy perpetrated by the u.s. over the last 2 administrations (16 years to be exact). let's not get too pious there davy
the fbi only investigates crimes. the only possible crime here is who unmasked general flynn's name on a top secret documents and leaked it to the press. that is a felony.<br/><br/>interactions with possible political ramifications is not a crime.<br/><br/>the one startling statement he made was that everything he has read in the newspapers the past couple of months, is false. that is embarrassing. <S_SEP> by trying to discredit and divert attention from the fbi investigation, president trump is already close to committing obstruction of justice. i expect that sean spicer and kellyanne conway will soon be seeking advice from criminal defense<br/>lawyers.
a provocative article. but there is one more thing i would like to know: what are the relationships among assange, snowden, putin and trump? has this line been pursued (if it can be)? there is so much smoke here--surely there must be a little fire somewhere. <S_SEP> the real question is, “does our congress and our intelligence agencies want to let this russian thing drag on into the third or fourth year of the trump presidency or nip it in the bud as soon as possible?” if there is no “there” there, then the sooner we find out the better it is for the trump presidency and the american people.
why is it taking so long for someone to leak the tax returns? obviously, many people have been looking through them and i hope they are an essential part of the investigation into russian ties. i'm surprised protests haven't erupted at russian embassies and consulates around the world. if it was the u.s. meddling in elections there would be protest all over the place. europeans are usually very good at this, yet i have not heard of anyone organizing massive protests against russian embassies and consulates there. <S_SEP> god speed and all power to the patriotic hackers and leakers! we haven't heard much from anonymous lately, but i hope they're working on this. or, please, someone within the irs.<br/><br/>get us those tax returns and any other dirty laundry you can dig up!
attention mr. kristof:<br/><br/>apparently you were wrong about mr. trump regarding a previous accusation about salacious behavior the russians supposedly had on him. <br/><br/>what if you are shown to be wrong again? i challenge you to apologize in your column if so. <br/><br/>you've made a career out of bullying and chastising when you aren't the one in the arena. instead you scream your own vitriol from within the protection of the exalted fourth estate.<br/><br/>you also accuse mr. trump of having no evidence there was any wire-tapping. where is your evidence for the charges you now bring? you should apologize immediately for the hypocrisy.<br/><br/>answer that challenge in one of your columns mr. kristof. if you don't take responsibility for words you're no better than the person you accuse. <S_SEP> to properly monitor , uncover, and prosecute any of trump's illegal, traitorous, or just plain bad policies and actions we need to be very careful. once we are seen making a bunch of unproved, false, or misleading allegations we will be sidelined to the supermarket checkout stand with the national enquirer. <br/><br/>talking points memo says (and politifact and others similarly say), "the watered-down language that ultimately ended up in the platform called for the u.s. to provide “appropriate assistance,” rather than lethal weapons, to ukraine to push back against russian intervention." <br/><br/>it is unclear who proposed which language, and it is unclear if the substitution was wrong-headed or just being careful. it is best if a candidate is not locked into a narrow policy before alternatives are examined -- no? let's not jump to conclusions, and instead keep a file and keep searching for the truth. kristof is doing us a service by keeping such a file. there is a lot out there that is proven and wrong. as these add up (and with trump's tax returns and maybe a whistleblower here or there) there should be enough to convince more and more former trump supporters in congress and in the general public to do something -- at least vote for the right people in 2018.
, current government, foreign governments, trump's business indebtedness it is critically important to investigate possible corruption of the election, but it is immediately critical to investigate the corruption of the current government by trump business indebtedness and use of the office of president to profit his businesses. foreign governments and wealthy oligarchs may be calling the shots for the us government if we can't demand enough transparency to prevent it. <S_SEP> this is a crisis of huge proportion. i think the integrity of our government and institutions are at stake. the president's administration is trying to destroy any confidence that citizens have in our system. if there is to be any hope of survival, a truly independent investigation is required. however, i am starting to doubt we are capable of such a thing.
i respectfully submit that this investigation is a waste of time and money and adds to government gridlock. lost in this red herring search is the quest for equitable tax reform and healthcare insurance reform. <S_SEP> it isn't a waste of people's time to find out the veracity of these claims. the truth is important. while some may wish to put on blinders; others wish to have the unvarnished non gold-plated truth. while some may feel that enabling unethical, self motivated or dishonest behavior is an acceptable price to pay, there are those of us who feel that this will weaken the foundation of this country and spread rot through very core of the structure that is our country.
raging against trump and his cohort does little to advance our knowledge and understanding of the trump motives with respect to russia. the rage, indeed the outrage of the american people should be focused on a weak kneed gop congress who forsake our national security while using the trump smoke screen to advance their legislative agenda. <S_SEP> one other thing, nick: trump would never ever allow his campaign staff to contact the russians without his permission. i doubt whether he would allow any member of his team to do much more than visit the toilet without his consent. he's a (tiny) hands-on guy who takes personal credit for anything and everything. who would possibly have taken such risks without his knowing about it?
come on people, i know it's a cliche, but there is absolutely zero doubt that hillary or any democratic president who acted like trump would be impeached. the hubble telescope's magnification is not sufficient to locate the microscopic particle man-parts of republican members of congress. they should be impeached as well. i don't think they deserve to even be citizens or to live in our country...which they are quickly turning into a farcical banana republic. <S_SEP> when will congressional leaders have had enough of the pathological liar whose campaign may well have committed treason by colluding with a foregin powerr to disurpt a presidential election?<br/><br/>i disagree with mike pence on pretty much everything, and he will be more effective than the incompetent current president at passing things i don't like. but mike pence at least seems to have a normal politician's appreciation for the truth -- and for democracy. i can't say that about the present occupant of the white house.<br/><br/>mr. trump is making our country a joke with his audacious lying. surely there are republican leaders in congress who value the nation and its institutions more than they fear trumpite primaries in their gerrymandered districts.<br/><br/>or are there?
i remember after 9/11 sitting on a bar stool in red bank, nj, talking to a guy about this very thing: all anybody seemed to care about was whose mouth clinton had his appendage in while reports coming from a woman about terrorists plotting an attack were ignored. i remember thinking even at this time as i was saying those words, hey, this guy's eyes were growing wildly larger, almost twirling in their sockets. <br/><br/>the point is this, and i truly hope i'm wrong: men ( even good, sensible, smart ones) seem to be constantly overtaken with these type of things. i really believe this is a great part of why we're in this mess. the men who believe so strongly in trump live vicariously through him, in myriad ways. how about this crazy idea: a woman special prosecutor? yeah, crazy, right? <S_SEP> how do you have a real investigation of the president when nearly every corner of our government is under the control of people put their by the president, or are in their own way just as bad as the president, and meanwhile the people who put them all their with their votes show little sign of even the smallest regret for what they have done? <br/><br/>besides that, what have we really learned new about this president since the election that has fundamentally added to what was already known about him before the election and which people voted for him anyway?<br/><br/>its going to be a very long four years, and at this point lets hope that is all it is. <br/><br/>(p.s. every day that goes by the chance of my ever being able to forgive those who voted for this guy gets slimmer and slimmer.)
in all this choas, hope trump heard...loud &amp; clear...john dean's expert advice: "cover-ups don't get easier as they proceed." <S_SEP> you are referencing and conflating the wrong issue, blah blah, which conservatives tend to do regularly. clapper was talking about there being no fisa warrant that would have allowed the fbi to tap trump's phones in nyc. and there is no evidence obama ever make a request for a warrant. but our wonderful president refuses to believe that, or any other facts that don't align with his delusions. <br/><br/>try those facts on for size.
#6: trump refuses to reveal his tax returns. why? how entwined is he with russian oligarchs, who are thugs aligned with the government?. is there extortion (the embarrassing tape of trump cavorting in russia during the miss universe pageant). furthermore, the unusual praise for putin by trump, on many occasions, absent any criticism, is suspicious. there is smoke here and there will be fire. <S_SEP> why does this feel so much like watergate deja vu? when someone like trump has a history of lying why should we ever believe him? me thinks he protests to much.<br/><br/>trump during the campaign wanted us to ignore the source of bogus information about hillary clinton. now all he wants us to do is conduct a witch hunt for those sources and to ignore the bright flame of russian influence on our election. trump can yell i am not a crook all he wants but that only convinces most of us that he is one.
because the russians didn't fiddle with the voting machines,(george soros did that , right), doesn't diminish the fact they influenced the minds of the voters. how is it you are so willing to be waltzed down the path to infamy by trump and his republican cohorts. mark my words, donald j. trump, will be taken out of the oval office in handcuffs. <S_SEP> a small correction to this editorial in the last paragraph.<br/>"the goal must be to make american political parties and democratic institutions less vulnerable to efforts to distort the electoral process as the russians and republicans have carried out."<br/>the height of hypocrisy was trump's failure to commit to accepting the results of the because they were rigged. indeed!
the president's "brazen warning shots" may indeed "do enormous damage to public confidence in the f.b.i.'s investigation," but the damage would have been a lot worse if he weren't so obviously and demonstrably a habitual liar, particularly about topics like this. perhaps he will one day stop and reflect on the value of a reputation for honesty, and on how much he has lost by sacrificing his own. <S_SEP> "these brazen warning shots from the president do enormous damage to public confidence in the f.b.i.’s investigation."<br/>i don't understand why that should be so.<br/>who (apart from his rusted-on followers) believes donald trump anymore?
are you actually comparing the hacking and attempted hijacking of the american election by russia - a hostile dictatorship that wants to destabilize europe and humiliate and delegitimize american democracy to the clinton/sanders imbroglio?<br/><br/>that is like comparing a 100 car pile up on the interstate to a fender bender. <S_SEP> what does one do if it is proven that the president and his party in power colluded with a foreign nation to affect our national election? this is a theft not so much from the democratic party as it is from the nation as a whole. i'm not sure that crimes and misdemeanors come any higher.
add in another russian connection: trump reversed his pledge to mandate u.s. steel for the keystone pipeline "paving the way for the use of a stockpile of steel manufactured in canada by a subsidiary of evraz, a company in which russian billionaire roman abramovich owns nearly a one/third stake. abramovich, estimated to be worth $8.9 billion, who ranks no. 151 on forbes list of the 500 wealthiest people in the world, has longstanding personal and political ties to russian president vladimir putin, whom president trump has repeatedly praised." <S_SEP> flood your gov't reps with calls demanding this, deflection and minimizing wont suffice in a matter this grave. putin can win favor, but the u.s. president cant have his help getting elected in exchange. what are we in bizzarro land? i know the power of the executive branch has grown but this is ridiculous. we cant let this lying neophyte direct things. it is the absolute understatement of the year that we need an independent committee.
trump's tweets attacking the investigation constitute obstruction of justice. he should be indicted and impeached. <S_SEP> the reason this situation receives the attention it does, is because there have never been allegations of collusion with an enemy government to win an election . it makes watergate look like eighth grade antics. if it can be proven, it is treason. in addition, every day brings some boorish behavior to antagonize our allies--our president who couldn't shake hands with angela merkel--i winced. drag the british into the tapping accusation. what next? i want a functioning government, and as of now, we don't have one. god help us.
when trump joined in the chorus of "lock her up!" he was giving in to his own inner fears--with good reason. his tweet about obama's wire-tapping authorization is a sign of panic what may he do next? as the two eminent psychiatrists imply in their letter in today's nyt, trump is a danger to himself, to the american people, and in fact to the world at large. <S_SEP> now that president trump has been declared a liar by the fbi it is likely that he will be impeached. that means his tenure may be less than 11 months. using the logic of the gop of 2016, the senate should wait for the next president to appoint a supreme court justice.
to really get the country back we'll need competitive congressional elections restored. the gerrymandering done by both sides, although more so by republicans, means that members of congress pick their voters rather than voters picking a congressional representative. <br/><br/>citizens united made it possible for the american oligarchs to pick federal representatives not we the people. <S_SEP> in 2000 in bush v. gore, the dems were all of a sudden for states rights snd the republicsns were for federalism. <br/><br/>people argue what will get them what they want. <br/><br/>fixed principles? not so much.
funny you should mention "house of cards":<br/><br/>"modern russian spymasters get their ideas about the west from the west itself—they are generally convinced that the american political system is accurately portrayed by house of cards. if russian disruption efforts were more successful during the 2016 american election, it was not because the russians have become so much better at what they do or have finally developed a sophisticated understanding of american politics—it is because american politics have come to resemble the tv caricatures." source: russia: the conspiracy trap, by masha gessen, in: the new york review of books<br/><a href="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/06/trump-russia-conspiracy-trap/" title="https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/06/trump-russia-conspiracy-trap/" target="_blank">https://www.nybooks.com/daily/2017/03/06/trump-russia-conspiracy-trap/</a> <S_SEP> yesterday i listened the questions during the hearing regarding the of the links between trump and the russians on my car radio. when i heard that trump had sold a property to a russian milllionare for over 100 that was worth 40 million my mouth dropped open. it's called a 60 million bribe. comey couldn't comment on this " transaction" because of the ongoing investigation. he didn't need to- any idiot can see what's going on. we have the manchurian candidate as the potus. i can't wait until i read the "trump impeached for treason" headline.
i remain curious about the lack of reporting by the nytimes on wilbur ross's connections to the russians through his ownership of the bank of cyprus. included in that pot of information is the item about ross bringing the former head of deutsche bank to the bank of cyprus as its new chief. deutsche bank is trump's biggest foreign lender.... the bank of cyprus is a favorite for russian money laundering. the guardian and mother jones have both done excellent jobs looking at this tangle involving secretary ross. fake news? please tell us that, if so. if not fake news, it should go on the list of 'dots' connecting the trump administration to the russians. <S_SEP> sorry to burst your bubble but they are pursuing those dots- though not yet with an independent commission. certainly the fbi has been pursuing them. i'm not making any charges yet but for the reasons cited by nick and pretty much everyone else who doesn't confuse the donald with mahatma gandhi it seems to me that there's far more likelihood of collusion between trump and the russians than there is of a romance between bibi and the ayatollah.
it's a shame the nytimes and the other news outlets were not connecting the dots before the election. <S_SEP> we do need a commission to investigate these allegations and get to the bottom of this issue. we cannot assume that there were contacts that were inappropriate; we must know the truth. only then can we decide how to respond.<br/>americans cannot wait much longer for this matter to be resolved. appoint an independent commission and take care of it. find the truth!
"the top priority now must be to ensure that the f.b.i.’s investigation, which could result in criminal prosecutions, is shielded from meddling by the trump administration.."<br/><br/>you must be referring to bill clinton meeting with ag loretta lynch while she was investigating his wife. that kind of meddling. that this paper totally blew off as inconsequential. <S_SEP> the obstruction from the white house has already begun. there will be more tweets about fake news, more statements of denial from spicer, and more silence from the republican congress, whose members are complicit in the obstruction of truth.<br/>it's difficult to hold onto any faith that justice will be served, and therein lies the tragedy of our current nightmare.
i feel like putin and russia have more control of our government, particularly the executive branch, than the american people. there is massive circumstantial evidence linking the trump administration with russia. i want all responsible for helping the russians to severely damage our democracy to be investigated and brought to justice. most of all, i want our country back. <S_SEP> am i misremembering, or did trump not once say that he had met putin and putin said he was 'brilliant'? then a russian speaker chimed in and said that the word putin actually used was better translated as 'colourful'....<br/>i truly believe that not only the us but the whole 'western world' is in balance at the moment - and it all depends on whether enough members of congress can put aside their venality long enough to clean out the trump swamp.
none may call it treason but congress and us investigators best determine quickly if it is treason or incompetence. meanwhile, wikileaks and russia continue their assault on the united states without counter. <S_SEP> not since the shocking days of the events leading up to, and including, the watergate hearings have we as a people been so challenged and obligated to abandon partisanship and join, as a nation, in recognizing a genuine threat to the republic that may be uncovered and documented in the near future.<br/>we can hope that things may not be as bad as they seem, but we must be prepared to discover that they might be a good deal worse.
comey must be sleeping well knowing that he protected us from hillary's emails. <br/><br/>sigh... <S_SEP> comey is an avowed neocon.
excellent analysis, dave! as is often the case, multiple factors are surely at play here. but given the president's financial track record, money is likely chief among them. so yes, indeed, follow the money. <S_SEP> that tells the honesty of those who works in irs. please share the cartoon with the rest of the world!
if the softening of the language in the rnc platform to remove the promise to supply the ukraine government with arms to fight against putin backed rebels wasn't enough, the proposed 37% cut in the state department is the smoking gun. this comes as a completely silent rex tillerson smiles for the cameras as andrea mitchell is pushed out of the room for having the temerity to ask a question.<br/>where are our heroes, and who among the gop will stand up and admit that our government has been co-opted by the kremlin? is satisfying special interests so important that abandoning our sovereignty is acceptable? <S_SEP> "bi-partisan, independent": key words if american democracy is to survive.
schiff is already acting the funeral director, and the nyt is eagerly laying out the funeral clothes. it kind of reminds me of the opening ceremony of clinton's impeachment trial with the republicans solemnly marching in in their dark suits hardly able to conceal their anticipation for what they hoped would be clinton's final end. how disappointed they would be by the outcome as will be the nyt and the democrats for being so premature in wanting to bury trump. the process cannot be rushed especially by those who are too eager for it to be done. impeachment is a subtle art which is best left unpracticed by the unwary and the unskilled. <S_SEP> i just hope the nyt and washinton post spare no expense to get to the bottom of this trump/russia craziness as best we can and as quick as possible.
jeff sessions didn't exactly come clean about speaking to the russian ambassador, either ... and he was under oath! <S_SEP> kate mckinnon impersonator jeff sessions is a party hack; a man with no integrity.
i'm just in shock that the gop congress are such fierce supporters and enablers knowing all of this information. it would appear that impeaching trump and having pence take office would be a win-win situation for them. i really hope the smoking gun is found quickly. i'm not sure how much more i can take of this. <S_SEP> wondering when the i-word will start getting used. if clinton was impeached for lying about an affair - something most people would initially lie about i think - doesn't this carry much more significance? but then, the notion of jeff pence getting a promotion is pretty scary. how do you like him now?
russia is the central story of the so called president and his cronies. <br/><br/>everything else is a distraction. all his destruction, corruption, criminal violations of the constitution are all small beer next to the russia story. <S_SEP> the salient disclosure to actual adult readers has to have been the complete annihilation of the coastal media's ''blame-russia'' meme to explain how such a smart person as hillary clinton completely failed to manage a presidential run after planning it for three decades. <br/><br/> hillary sunk herself, and the russians did nothing in any of the six surprise states of no. car., fla., mich., wis., penn., or ohio. nothing to the election equipment, nothing to the counting, nothing to anything. <br/><br/> while openly admitting this would probably result in times-ers getting fired, the rest of us have alternative news sources not bound by the progressive omerta'.<br/> but you are begged to stay scared, filled with hate, and otherwise ignorant about the big events going on in d.c. these days, such as the internecine civil war still going on among the permanent employees hidden among the departments of state and justice as well as the intelligence agencies.
wow, hawk! you've never heard of disinformation? you take everything at face value--when it fits your pre-decided premise?<br/><br/>russia's intent is to muddy the soup, create internal conflict, by actions which you describe--but yet you took the bait! (and the hook!) you concluded exactly what they wanted you to, blame dems, minimize the russian role. (you are following moscow's playbook.)<br/><br/>"stopping" cyber-attacks--how's that done? "easy," according to you. i'm beginning to suspect you might be the plant whose purpose is to cast doubt and drive the wedge of division deeper. hate to tell you, sir: stopping cyber-attacks, even after one takes place, is not as "easy" as it seems. <S_SEP> many of us, myself included, begged the times, right after the tussle on the platform plank surfaced, to put more into the ties to russia than the (ridiculously repeated) front page articles about clinton's emails. i often wonder what it felt like to be the morton thiokol engineers who implored nasa to not launch the challenger on the morning of the disaster, or the intelligence personnel who contributed to and drafted the "bin laden to strike in us" (with planes) pdb that bush ignored. ... well, i hardly put myself in that category, but i have a hint of it. the problem here is that there isn't a spectacular catastrophe like the challenger or wtc attacks, there is a fast-moving but not visual, not sudden, not explosive, erosion of everything we believe in, and most importantly--our government--the state department, the checks on the president by congress. it's already been put into motion. the dye is cast. and without a very muscular 'full-court press' willing to be as nasty as the president is/will be to falsely defend himself [by projecting onto others ("hillary clinton will be the most corrupt politician ever to hold the office, if she is elected..."; "the press is the enemy of the people", etc) or by saying the most offensive things about everyone involved], we can lose everything--much more than healthcare. bannon's objectives must be addressed. if nothing else, the president will spend us into oblivion as we did the ussr. what better desserts for vladimir putin?
, russia's interference in the election gene you are only getting part of it. you are equating two things, which although both are bad, are not the same . there is a difference between the usual dirty politics inside our country which we need to deal with and the interference of a dangerous leader of another country whose interests are diametrically opposed to ours, in our election. it also seems like there is a lot more than just the interference in the election, which is bad enough. we have an administration that is beholden to if not controlled by a dangerous foreign power. can you not see the difference and the danger? there is also a great danger to the world's other democracies, because it seems that russia is interfering in their elections as well. the future of our country and the balance of power in the world is at stake here. get with it gene and stop with the false equivalence while we still have a country, which it may not be for very long. it seems, like germany in the thirties where my family was murdered, that we have enough so-called americans who hate other people so much that it overrides any love or concern for our country. that is how this dangerous demagogue got into the oval office and it looks like many people are willing to let him destroy our country just so other people may not have imagined rights that are wrongly perceived to be little bit more than what somebody else might have. <S_SEP> it appears the russians have vetted trump, his staff, family, and cabinet picks better than the republican senators. if it's worthwhile to them, shouldn't it be worthwhile to us?
"...trump’s furious denunciations of the press and of barack obama, to the point that he sometimes seems unhinged. journalists have learned that when a leader goes berserk and unleashes tirades and threats at investigators, that’s when you’re getting close."<br/><br/>how can you tell, nick? i thought that was his everyday demeanor. <S_SEP> sad to see nick fall into the fever swamp of conspiracy theory. clapper said there is no evidence of a conspiracy and until facts are produced (which won't happen) i will take his word over rank over rank conjecture.
how can you make the assertion in your last paragraph without having seen trump's tax returns?<br/><br/>as to your question regarding putin doing things differently with aid from the trump campaign - well one could look at the differences between the initial leaks and the subsequent leaks. <S_SEP> , trump, russian money did anyone see the marie le pen interview on 60 minutes where she admitted russia lent her campaign $11 million? it is not so far fetched that russian money has funded the trump organization. and why are we no longer hearing about the emoluments clause that he is in clear violation? his baseless accusations regarding voter fraud and president obama hacking him should have consequences - amendment 25! and finally, do not let sessions off the hook, he lied under oath and he should be forced to resign.
“i can see russia from my house"<br/>.....sunny isles, florida (immediately north of miami) is known, locally, as little moscow. entire floors of glitzy trump condos are owned by russians, their agents or llcs. <S_SEP> of course you understand the difference between reds and russians, right?
why in the world should any of us believe trump, putin, sessions, comey and all the rest. the agencies, the governments, the military. the press for that matter. as global resistance mounts, the vile behavior of one should not throw us into the arms of another. <S_SEP> it is a huge risk that we have a president who lies so transparently. if the circumstances require the u.s. to go to war, who would believe our president if he calls our nation to action?
" ...lie, mislead and obfuscate, with startling audacity" is, of course, trump's trademark, but would suggest to change 'audacity' to "mendacity", as this irresponsible thug knows not the difference between fiction (his version) and fact; it is as if he were living in an alternate reality where his fantasies are being 'aborted' by a cruel world, unresponsive, finally, to his ill-devised will. now that we know the republican congress lost all credibility, being complicit in trump's lies, trying to distract us with faulting the 'leaks' and not the crime itself. i understand we humans are all potentially corruptible, but didn't think our political prostitutes would be selling themselves so cheap. <S_SEP> more than anything trump has said so far, his denunciation of journalists as the enemy of the people is a transparent admission on his part that he has something to hide. it is also a statement that calibrates the current reality: our congress will not investigate him because republicans value power over transparency. to steal a line from nixon, "now more than ever" we need the fourth estate since it seems to be the one remaining institution willing to hold a budding tyrant accountable. alas, this may not be enough since it is more than apparent that we live in a confederacy of dunces (john kennedy toole)
i have personal experience borrowing hundreds of millions of dollars from kremlin backed russian oligarchs for my luxury hotel business as gortune magazine has reported <a href="https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2014/09/04/aman-resorts-nasty-battle-for-luxury-hotel-chain/?source=dam?client=safari" title="https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2014/09/04/aman-resorts-nasty-battle-for-luxury-hotel-chain/?source=dam?client=safari" target="_blank">https://www.google.com/amp/amp.timeinc.net/fortune/2014/09/04/aman-resor...</a>. the thing i have learned is that once you take money from them (it's always indirect loans from oligarchs not the russian government) its not like a typical bank loan. they own you. your life belongs to them and if you deviate from what they want they have hidden subtle untraceable ways of destroying your life--they are not shy about telling you this to your face knowing noone can point the finger back to them and prove they did anything.--and then if you actually try to resist they follow through on it, in every imaginable insidious manner possible. they make you pledge your crown jewel assets-- for trump i am sure it's his hotel brand--then they blackmail, frame you, get you arrested w fake evidence, and then foreclose on the loan, steal your business without proper cause --you cannot imagine the depths to which these people will sink after you have borrowed money from them. and if and when you resist like i did they have infiltrated some of the most powerful law firms in the country and the the mud that is thrown at you not even the fbi can discern if it's real or unreal. sad state of affairs but now afterwards i don't blame trump for kowtowing to the kremlins line. <S_SEP> #11: the $100 million sale of a $40 million dollar property by trump to a russian oligarch. if that does not raise suspicion, what would?<br/>#12: reports that the airplane owned by the same oligarch was located at the same airport as trump's plane several times during the campaign. either a very strange coincidence or a clandestine meeting.
"patriotic leakers"? one certainly hopes so, notwithstanding the meager support those patriots received from the press during the obama years, when they faced unprecedented government prosecution. but journalists? surely you can't mean the one and five percenters who attend the white house corresponds' dinner and laugh at the president's jokes and can't be expected to risk their tv appearances and their bylines if telling the truth is uncomfortable?<br/><br/>how long, for example, has david leonhardt been demanding that the congress and the fbi investigate the ties of america's business and banking elite to saudi arabia?<br/><br/>trump, in offering a grotesque parody of an american president, reveals the depravity of the whole. <S_SEP> .<br/><br/>the storming that the republicans put on this afternoon demanding to know who is leaking information is rather like making a federal case out of what film was playing when lee harvey oswald ducked into the movie theater. <br/><br/>one can give benefit of the doubt and ascribe this obfuscation as a matter of "misplaced priorities" only up to a point. <br/><br/>.
the smoking gun is trump's refusal to release his tax returns. if there is smoke, there is fire.<br/><br/>if there was nothing in those returns that would cast a shadow on his business dealings, it would be logical that he would have released them last year.<br/><br/>he is afraid to release them, and the bottom line for that fear is either evidence of a blatant lie that not even his "truthful hyperbole" model of twisting the truth will justify, or the returns will show him for the business fraud that many think he is. a house of cards on both counts. <S_SEP> lots of people have referenced rachel maddow. her coverage the last few weeks has been great and consise, but she is not reporting on anything new. there have been several people, some reporters with sources, some intrepid sleuths working from publically available data who have been reporting for months what rachel has been reporting for a week. most are extremely active on twitter, some have been on msnbc and other networks. the women especially have been called lunatics and much worse. one had a twitter fight with roger stone this past weekend that resulted in stone deleting incriminating past tweets and showing his true colors.<br/><br/>taxes are what put al capone away and it will be the same with trump. that and readily available public documents found by patient and diligent people who are connecting the dots in this huge spider web. not to mention that certain people such as stone, giuliani and even sessions can't seem to keep any sort of secret without projecting, hinting and acting as smug as 8 year olds. there are too many cooks in this pot and sooner or later one will cave. my money is on carter page, who doesn't look like he's willing to take the fall for anyone.
here's another very important dot:<br/><br/>1. many key gop members of congress are acting in ways that defy logic by refusing to investigate. perhaps it's not a lack of logic or thirst for power, but instead an indication that the hacking of the rnc was more substantial than the public was made aware of? is gop resistance to investigation fueled by possible blackmail? <S_SEP> manuroc:<br/>a screen of smoked herrings; mmm...sounds like kippers for breakfast.<br/><br/>i remember a time when rl made cogent points. these days he is another poster ii skip over except to check what he just said to have everyone so berserk. his increasing use of all caps generally corresponds with the decrease in coherence and plausibility of his remarks, although the bit about the jurassic clintons made me laugh out loud. (the media made so much daily ado about the nothing sandwiches of the clintons activities when pterodactyls ruled the skies that it should give anyone pause before considering an independent prosecutor, but that's another column.). <br/><br/>we all know if the shoe were on the other foot, if president hrc were spending multimillion dollar weekends doing deals at her private resort and ignoring emoluments, etc etc, the benghazi hearings would have been a pleasant footrub compared to the investigations the gop would have launched. she'd already be impeached by now. probably locked up.
you forgot big mouth gulliani bragging about some revelations about to be disclosed. you also missed rachel maddow's show the past few days. she shows how trump sold a horrible house in west palm to a russian that leveled it after trump made something like $40 million in less than 2 years on a house that no one else wanted. <S_SEP> nothing happened because mr. trump said nothing happened. that idea will be echoed by kellyanne conway, sean spicer, and a host of others who are continually putting their proverbial thumbs into trump's weakening dike. but it's okay because while the evidence continues to mount against the president, he takes off on campaign trips to whip up his partisans and restate what are now very old campaign promises. and the partisans love it to the point of gushing support for the man. he, then, returns to the white house invigorated and emboldened to continue his flights into another fantasy.
thanks mr. kristof for recounting the details of what we know so far. this will forever stand as a giant question mark to remind us that the republicans persist in keeping any and all congressional investigations of these matters behind closed doors. <S_SEP> rosenstein has been in public service for 27 years. he's a real civil servant. it's a good pick.
"the first lady is from slovenia, of former soviet union. why isn't she part of the connecting dots? what if she is the spy?"<br/><br/>jesus wept. she isn't part of the connecting dots because slovenia was most certainly not part of the soviet union, and is nowhere near any part of it. it is a member of nato and the european union. before that, it was part of yugoslavia, a non-aligned country. before that, it was part of austria. <br/><br/>some people seriously need geography and history lessons. <S_SEP> hey european, really? you do have a computer so researching the uranium for pay play should have been easy. it is false, untrue, a lie. come said much more then that, he h=gave timelines and specifics. at one point he said, sarcastically - could tis all be coincidence? and the answer was possible (as anything is possible....) but highly improbable.....
it's the "wag the dog" move -misdirect to change the subject. often, presidents start wars to move our attention. woe unto all of us if trump makes that aggressive move. <S_SEP> to change the subject nothing like a war to do it. north korea great distraction sadly offering up the risk of millions of lives to keep oneself in power has been done before in history, trump does not seem willing to hurt his brand how much remains to be seen. the gop has an obligation to get beyond party and look out for the interests of the country unless they are willing to go down with trump and bannon.
mr. kristof, you say “when friends press me about what i think happened, i tell them that my best guess is that there wasn’t a clear-cut quid pro quo”. that’s nice. glad your friends pressed you on that so you decided to write this column. but so what if there’s no clear quid pro quo? <br/><br/>you mean like there’s no actual, provable, clear-cut ‘quid pro quo’ between our corporate megadonors to our elections and our politicians they sponsor---as the supreme court ruled in justifying its citizens united decision? no quid pro quo, so they blessed unlimited big money donations calling them part of 1st amendment right to ‘freedom of speech’. so many ways to spin it. almost reminds one of soviet union propaganda in its warping of the truth.<br/><br/>obviously the influences on lawmaking are there all the same. otherwise corporate donors wouldn’t be making such huge investments in our politics. <br/><br/>it’s said trumpf couldn’t get us banks to lend him, so he went to russian banks. vox says “russian investors have been instrumental in helping him cope with all the credit problems he has thanks to his serial bankruptcies.”<br/><br/>you said it, kristof----unhinged and berserk. is that in the psychiatric dsm manual of mental illness, we’ve been hearing about lately?<br/>this president is already a momentous scandal. <S_SEP> there's rarely a clear cut quid pro quo around any business dealing - that's an illusion - and this was a business deal in the mind of trump since he didn't expect to win either. the absence of a clear cut quid pro quo doesn't make it any more ambiguous or less transactional ; rather it's a fluid and ongoing negotiation to get as much as you can. give and take, back and forth. i think you are right in every other regard.
, flights here are more dots as reported elsewhere by credible reports:<br/>11. donald trump bought a palm beach mansion for $40m at a bankruptcy auction, sold it after minimal improvements to dmitry rybolovlev, the billionaire russian "fertilizer king" for $95m. trump was in some financial distress at the time.<br/>12. donald trump's private plane and rybolovlev's were seen near each other on the same tarmacs several times during the presidential campaign.<br/>13. other flight tracking information shows rybolovlev's plane in the hamptons and other locations when members of the trump team were in the same places.<br/><br/>plenty of dots to commission an independent investigation. <S_SEP> and more dots: mcclatchy reports russian oligarch dmitry rybolovlev's plane shows up along the campaign trail (and flight logs also show in croatia when jared and ivanka were on vacation there with wendy murdoch, who may or maynot have dated putin)....and the mercury news points to ivanka and jared's ultra-rich russian friends who they openly hang with at the us open...and then there's the banks and billionaire investors like yuri milner, who the times reported back in january are helping keep the kushners afloat.... maybe there is an innocent explanation for this, right?
there are no dots needed for distinction just a firm emboldened straight line....any other belief is that of an alternate world reveled and engrossed in alternative facts!!" <S_SEP> one does not need houdini to connect the dots - but what is needed is proof - evidence and that will come in time.
the republicans are not going to do anything. they are too power hungry and see an opportunity to destroy everything they have been salivating over for years. look at any picture of paul ryan with that disgusting smirk on his face, he is giddy with excitement at the prospect of destroying social programs seniors and others live on. we, the people, have to do what needs to be done to stop this train wreck. <S_SEP> who, i have to ask, would qualify to be on this "collaborative, bipartisan team of statesmen? in particular, which republicans fit the description? in the senate lindsay graham and john mccain have been the most outspoken in pushing back against trump, but their efforts have been at best half-hearted and neither has had any problem rubber-stamping trump's nominees. ben sasse showed some promise a few months back but his name hasn't surfaced in the news in several weeks, at least not since the inauguration. as for mitch mcconnell, trump has him on a choke chain with a short leash. recently, ted cruz has been cautiously criticizing the president. big whoop.<br/><br/>in the house, paul ryan sports the same neck wear as his senate counterpart. the entire republican house has donned blinders and, like a well-trained mule, plows straight ahead, heeding only the call of "gee!" and ignoring or refusing to "haw," even when the integrity of the united states is plainly, direly at risk.<br/><br/>there are, simply put, no republicans who meet the definition of "statesman" in either legislative chamber. absent a spate of conversions comparable to that of saul of tarsus, there will not be one for the foreseeable future.
emperor donnie always ran his companies using every means of maintaining secrecy, including requiring just about every person who dealt with him to sign a non-disclosure agreement. if he was displeased by the behavior or activities of any employee, he could just fire hat person, no questions asked.<br/><br/>he is about to learn that, even with "commissars" installed in every government agency to ferret out disloyalty to him, he is now involved in a *public* government in which he cannot keep everything under wraps, and in which there are two other co-equal branches that do not have to dance to his tune.<br/><br/>his error in thinking will prove to be his undoing. all of the dirt is going to come out. wait and see. <S_SEP> if the usa "board of directors" selected a new ceo, who immediately publicly touted our deceptive competitor as being the same as us; called all our established customers and told them they need to pay more and respect us better; then said disparaging things about our family ties...ceo little donnie would have been shown the door the first week.<br/><br/>you are not the winner if you cheat. little donnie is illegitimate as president, and a farce of a businessman.
omg, this is like nixon on manson with a side of hiccups. stop it, donald! i don't care what cohn sold you about insanity defenses! <S_SEP> good article. <br/><br/> i fall into the 'all of the above' category. <br/><br/>however, i have one small quibble. donald's mental stability, or lack thereof, wasn't mentioned. this is a man who would gleefully destroy a country to enrich himself personally. there may not be a clinical definition for that kind of crazy, but we're looking at it.
dream on, disaffected and bitter clintonistas. you were right about comey and the fbi last fall; what's different (besides the painfully obvious) now? your scorched earth policy will be your ultimate ruination. <S_SEP> carl, that is hilarious. there was a never ending flood tide of implications against the fully registered and audited clinton foundation. in the meantime, it took an out if town reporter to uncover that the trump foundation was an unregistered, unaudited, self dealing, bestower of illegal political contribution for which sanctions were levied. it was the trump foundation that was proscribed from any further fundraising and effectively shut down. yet the aspersions about the clinton foundation, and about her "home brewed server" were the ones that never did stop being consequential.<br/>if you can't see the difference, consider the dozens of benghazi inquests, and compare it to this president getting a pass for not only authorizing an "operation manhood" raid that obama thought too risky that killed a seal, but he then cynically used his widow in a speech before congre$$. and who among the republicans who had a constant drumbeat of complaint about four dead in benghazi had even a single complaint about a dead seal in yemen?
mr. leonhardt said it correctly. look no further than comey, and giuliani's back-door key to the fbi's new york office. <S_SEP> will ivanka accept heading the fbi?<br/>will so called "president" trump deny that he even knows montafort?<br/>will psycho don create his own commission with an "independent counsel" judge napolitano to head a commission with melania and baron von trump?<br/><br/>will terrapin mcconnell and eddie munster ryan show the pathological lying great showman the door to some mental health treatment?<br/>sad.<br/>loser
if russian mobsters invested in, or purchased trump properties or assets, wouldn't there be a public record to follow (real estate)? nyt, get on it! <S_SEP> sane and sharon -- paranoia strikes deep. no fakes news here, sane. if you think something i said was fake -- pls elaborate. <br/><br/>sharon -- tax returns are unlikely to reveal anything. and if trump has loans from russians for his real estate ventures, they almost assuredly predated his run for the presidency. so that would mean -- the russians are prescient? <br/><br/>progs need a more determined grip on reality.
it is unfortunate that the nyt's abandonment of objectivity in covering the trump campaign, and, arguably, its abdication of its responsibility as part of the democratic process, should now cast a cloud over its credibility in recommending a special prosecutor, when it should be the credibility of the president and his administration that is in focus <S_SEP> republicans are pigs; they are aiding and abetting felony crimnails currently in - and associated with - the white house.<br/><br/>obviously only a special, independent prosecutor and commission will get the truth out.<br/><br/>americans should be outraged and should call republican party freaks day and night until they cut trump loose.
, ukraine peace agreement i'm confident that julian assange will help get to the bottom of this since he seems so dedicated to truth with neither fear nor favor toward anyone. as for the so-called back-door peace proposal for ukraine, it is not so much "dubious" as it is outright bizarre. <br/><br/>it seeks to topple the legitimate ukrainian president, to cede crimea to russia (the proposed 50-100 year "lease" is laughable on the face of it) and to lift the sanctions on russia. the "deal" is advanced by shadowy thugs with ties to organized crime and fascist politics. the ukrainian government is doubtless thrilled with this "plan" that would turn the country into a russian vassal.<br/><br/>president trump's coddling of vladimir putin and russian interests during the campaign was downright mystifying. it made no sense at all. now that the tangled web of intrigue is unraveling, it is making more sense and the scent is most foul.<br/><br/>assange, release the president's tax returns!<br/><br/><a href="http://www.endthemadnessnow.org" title="www.endthemadnessnow.org" target="_blank">www.endthemadnessnow.org</a> <S_SEP> he's threatening to not reauthorize his spy's eyes through 702? why? afraid of what we might find?<br/><br/>what's he hiding? if he wants to examine the civility of surveillance, why not his own snail slime? is he as upset by the russian's big get and let? he doesn't seem so. he seems more concerned we will learn what really happened, and the whole show will flop over on him.
i cannot see any scenario where trump serves out his term. he's like a toddler about to tucker himself out during a long tantrum. the best we can hope for is impeachment, really. but then what? president pence would be equally unsavory and divisive, if not more so. <br/><br/>we need a cultural shift in america, and we need to respect learning and knowledge more than reality tv stars. the environment and community health are the two most important functions of our federal government, not global hegemony. how can we teach that to the trump camp, who will exist long after he leaves office? <S_SEP> thank god that the trump white house is incompetent. can you imagine being in this situation with a competent president?
how can we be sure the votes weren't tampered with?<br/>if there is no paper vote backup, there is no way to verify.<br/>every vote should have a paper backup for the voter to check and put in the ballot box. you can tally the paper votes and see<br/>if there is a discrepancy. <S_SEP> the real thing who brought us sarah palin. i'll take pepsi.
the sooner this con artist is impeached and imprisoned the safer our democracy will be. the fact that his tax returns and business schemes have not been made public is an indictment of the current leadership of the republican party, which increasingly resembles a cabal, not a party in a democratic republic. <S_SEP> where is the investigative journalism that exposed nixon? surely there are some deep throats with all those that have been shorted, slighted, demeaned by this vile human being who is insidiously eroding american values on every level.<br/>somebody please find this tax returns.
plus the conways have built their careers on attempting to destroy the clintons. george put up money for linda tripp's defense after she effectively entrapped monica lewinsky into 'fessing up about the affair, and illegally recorded the conversations. <S_SEP> , george conway, russian embassy and another story deserving attention: trump just appointed kellyanne conway's husband, george conway, to a top position in the justice department. great guy, hangs out at the russian embassy. (google it) represented a corporation accused of bribing russian officials. <br/><br/>i'm sure he'll be great.
i’m seeing red!<br/>bullys unite<br/>this matches trumps character <br/><br/>what do the other 65% do? those of us that are enlightened enough to see through fake news and scare tactics, are open-minded enough. we see that there’s no simple answer to life’s multi-faceted reality<br/>we aren’t even the aggressive type, need to conserve that energy for brain power<br/>this won’t help to fight even the other 35% that show they aren’t interested in playing fair or being decent<br/>let alone against the powerful, the corporations heads that own all of us <S_SEP> a punch in the nose to australia. a national insult to britain. a petulant, public snub of germany. a cabinet rife with unqualified-but-wealthy sycophants. a twice-defeated, illegal travel ban. a staff of terrified tap dancers at full odds with truth and reality. a healthcare promise as empty as a wind-filled paper bag twirling in the wind along the back nine of an all-too-often played florida golf course.<br/>collusion with the russians at the very highest levels. and so much more. all in just 60 days time.<br/>this american carnage must stop, right here, right now.
why is there no "understood process" for bringing the behavior<br/>of people in politics into the open?<br/>do we live in a "democracy" or a "cover-up congressional wealth-ocracy"? <S_SEP> the term you should be using is really, "plutocracy," rather than "oligarchy." although at some level of wealth, the respective venn diagrams overlap pretty completely.
brilliant! i agree with everything you so eloquently stated. thank you. <S_SEP> a very thoughtful, and logical point.
call your senators and representative to stress the importance of a broader independent bipartisan investigation. it's the only way we'll get the thorough, clear and detailed effort these most appalling events require.<br/>our democracy depends upon it. <S_SEP> you state that "this matter requires a broader investigation run by a collaborative, bipartisan team of statesmen." i fully agree with that position. however, collaboration, bipartisanship, and statesmen seem to be in short supply or altogether absent. like diogenes, i keep looking for an honest man and i am frustrated.
ted, my bad. indeed this is meant to be a joke because both ivana and melania are "immigrant" wives from eastern european countries perhaps sympathetic to russia? <S_SEP> the first lady is from slovenia, of former soviet union. why isn't she part of the connecting dots? what if she is the spy? what about ivanka's mother, ivana, a czech-american? any connection there? or are women beyond suspicion, although in james bond movies they play significant roles. do not "in a decade of glitz, they (donald and ivana) were the glitziest; in a decade of greed, they were the greediest: he the scrappy investor who made a fortune wheeling and dealing real estate, she the gregarious, czech-born outsider who charmed and clawed her way into new york's most refined social circles," people magazine once wrote about their marriage. "
so, because the boy cried wolf once too often, there will never be a wolf? is that what you're saying? <S_SEP> as "taylor" said in planet of the apes, "it's a madhouse! a madhouse!"
it seems like the gop is colluding with trump and his minions re: this russia affair. they need to stop colluding. where are the patriots? where are the truth seekers? where are the people of honor? missing in action. it is a national disgrace that this congress is dragging its' feet. we know they are perfectly willing to investigate democrats, benghazi is the perfect example. so what is stopping them here? crass party politics over the health of our form of government. i say, take off those flag lapel pins, republicans. actions speak louder than words. at this point you are not being americans we can be proud of. veterans must speak out. they fought for this country for this? <S_SEP> the republicans brought a knife to a gun fight yesterday. they counted on comey to refuse to comment across the board and then they could ask their meager questions about getting the leakers, following their con artist &amp; chief's tweets to that end. the whole world saw that redirect con. <br/><br/>i have to figure that republican members of the congress and the senate are having a whole lotta kitchen table conversations. what they are saying to their families i have no idea. but what they are thinking is: i'm selfish, so, which is the best choice for me to keep my job? standing up and acting like a patriot trying to preserve my country? or, do i keep saying what i'm told to say, cover his, um, tweets, and hope they don't take him down? such a tough decision...hmmm...
republican politicians - more concerned about their jobs, their perks, their power......than the citizens they represent or the security of this country. with an apparent total lack of curiosity about russian hacking into the very heart of our democratic process - our national election - they continue to obscure and distract, and persist in saying "there is nothing happening..move along". perspective here in "fly over" country is that both parties are awful but the republicans have taken the overwhelming lead in objectionable and self serving policies and behavior. <S_SEP> this presumes that the republicans care one whit about preserving democratic institutions and democracy itself. as if. <br/><br/>witness the craven obsequiousness of speaker ryan and sen. mcconnell himself with the waxing on about democracy re. neil gorsuch. these men will go down as disgraces to our body politic for putting their party and their power over our country. fat lot of patriots they are. why were the votes in 2016 more important than the ones in 2012. i should have had a right to have my vote count. our nation and merrick garland were done a huge disservice. if neil gorsuch had any character he would graciously move aside and let the hearings be on merrick garland.
"......when a leader goes berserk and unleashes tirades and threats at investigators, that’s when you’re getting close." this statement sums up what we all know - the bully in the white house is throwing tantrums because those whom he loathes so much are getting very close to unveiling the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. so....help us god! <S_SEP> the repub motto seems to be "if you see something, better not say anything".
the entire world holds obama in esteem, so why let trump leave a stain on his reputation by acknowledging his grasping conspiracy? barry's seen this scene about ill births before. trump is furious his declining ratings are raising barry's without effort! <S_SEP> we all value our public servants who are true to that inner conscious awareness of being human, which obama demonstrated in all of his actions, speeches an policies. if trump ever looks inside himself, this is the time to meditate, reflect on his thoughts, and confess, or to redeem his action.
no mention of bannon, the bantam perched on the shoulder of trump, a dark bird and eminence grise who, unlike cardinal richelieu, holds office? <S_SEP> you'll know you've hit a raw nerve when "twitler" starts referring to the white house as his "bunker" and begins ranting even further about "disloyal reporters who are enemies of the people". wait, sorry, he's already doing the second one.<br/>at any rate, he will surround himself with "loyal" followers in his "bunker" and tweet interminably until, perhaps, the end of april if history is any kind of teacher on such matters.<br/>tell me, does mr. bannon have a club foot much like one of his heroes in the past?
of course there was no quid pro quo. a wink and a nod accomplish the same thing and cannot be traced. <S_SEP> ok, he had that hour plus where he acted the part long enough to fool half the people for half the time.
chess master gary kasparov had the best comment on the hearing:<br/><br/>'the house is on fire, trump is running around with a box of matches, and the gop demands to know who called the fire department.'<br/><br/>excellent analogy. <S_SEP> garry kasparov put it perfectly on twitter yesterday, "the house is on fire, trump is running around with a box of matches, and the gop demands to know who called the fire department."
one more option: a combination of the points listed. what a mess. <S_SEP> quite on point!!
trump is unvetted;<br/><br/>know nothing about his finances and indebtedness<br/>know nothing about his health<br/>know nothing about his slovenian sphinx<br/>know he doesn't read<br/>know he can't write policy<br/>know he has no vision<br/>know his relationship with bannon and miller is alt-right<br/>know he's a bully<br/>know he's a liar<br/>know he stiffs people<br/>know he needs enemies<br/>know he's uneducated<br/>know he loves russia<br/>know he has no vocabulary<br/>know he's weak on decrying, anti-semitism, anti-muslim, anti-hispanic<br/>and the coup-de-grace he's a delusional, fabulist liar. <S_SEP> what do we know of our potus?<br/>unstable, first came to our notice,<br/>his lawyers and minions<br/>give him his opinions,<br/>when he ran t'was ill fortune bode us.<br/><br/>he came out of pandora's box,<br/>in need of a major detox,<br/>giving him their vote<br/>i must sadly note<br/>voters had heads full of rocks.
gop ultimately harming itself in trying to make leaking of info into something as bad as a president of the united states being -- or even seeming to be -- under influence of a nation whose values differ so much from ours, or at least used to.<br/>is president as loyal to us as he is to his lenders? <S_SEP> one should indeed fault gop members for supporting a president that is clearly delusional and has no sense of the consequences of his actions. support for a president clearly divorced from reality is a violation of their oath of office, and grounds for their removal from office.
this is one of your best. thank you. <S_SEP> thanks, that's great.
this column opens with a reference to comparing the trump adminstration to the netflix series, "house of cards." one of the trump campaign's most anxiety-provoking (and likely most effective) tv ads also opens with a more subliminal reference to "house of cards." the scene of an underpass in d.c. (where, perhaps not coincidentally, the democratic national committee headquarters is situated on the corner) with fast-paced foreboding music is a steal from the tv series. worth a look for a few seconds... <a href="https://www.facebook.com/realthetrumppledge/videos/1293937170653987/" title="https://www.facebook.com/realthetrumppledge/videos/1293937170653987/" target="_blank">https://www.facebook.com/realthetrumppledge/videos/1293937170653987/</a> <S_SEP> this is similar to the writer's thoughts about "house of cards". when i see hbo's political comedy "veep" which, 5 minutes ago, was hip and topical, now seems as quaint and ancient as "the beverly hillbillies"
going nuts?<br/>he's obviously been an off-the-hook wiggy nut since he began his reign of terror campaign. <S_SEP> soooo....you are ok with a president who is nuts?....oh...excuse me "slightly nuts"....good lord..
11/3/16 meeting in concord nc is the key!<br/>who did dmitry rybolovlev meet &amp; why-5 days before elections?<br/><a href="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/mobile/m-top-stories/article137115918.html" title="http://www.charlotteobserver.com/mobile/m-top-stories/article137115918.html" target="_blank">http://www.charlotteobserver.com/mobile/m-top-stories/article137115918.html</a> <S_SEP> jill stein is shown at putin's table in the famous photo of the rt dinner.<br/>sitting directly across from putin, with flynn on his right.<br/>where did her funding and marching orders come from?<br/>she and ralph nader should marry.
if one assumes the worst about the foreign interference with elections, it is not just a matter of the 2016 election, it is also future elections. whatever they did or tried to do they will try again and will be more capable of in the future. and the same technology and techniques will be used to influence elections in all the other countries. <S_SEP> npr and carnegie mellon university have reported that the us has interfered in at least 80 national elections around the world, including several during the clinton and obama administrations. why was election interference not an issue when the times was acting as a 24/7 campaign cheerleader for hillary?
that would be after the election. <S_SEP> if given the exact same circumstances and people involved with the exception being a democrat as president the impeachment process would already be in progress.
remember the years of "you're a great american" and "you are a true patriot" and "thank you for your service to this country" and "take our country back"? all of those flag waving self aggrandizing hypocrites now stand with a president who is co opted by russia.<br/><br/>whatever you think of him, john mccain is the real thing. the nearly lone voice from the republican side saying what we all see plain as day.<br/><br/>trump is a traitor. <S_SEP> i haven'ts seen a patriot in the republican party for a couple of decades. maybe mccain used to be, but he seems to have sold his nation down the drain so his party can remain in power. patriotism to one's party is not real patriotism.<br/>no, what will be needed is a vigorous and free press that will, finally, stop with its constant false equivalence meme and get to the bottom of t rump's treason. for treason it most certainly will prove to be.
djt's tweets are those of a desperate person. <S_SEP> i buy all of your "explanations," but i wonder if you've lost sight of the person you're talking about. these are all logical, based in reality. couldn't it be as simple as these guys are his friends? they bailed him out of bankruptcy. they expressed support for his candidacy. they've got his back. what's not to love if you're djt?
the whole thing makes me sick. yet, i listen to a cousin in north carolina who thinks i should be eating crow because of trumps overwhelming electoral college win.<br/>if one of the scenarios you pose proves true, i doubt you will get the republicans to condemn him or his followers to believe any evidence of wrongdoing. <S_SEP> is the dems eating crow all you care about? not the fact that the us is isolating itself on the world stage and losing respect daily because of the idiotic antics of your government? wake up!
in florida this past weekend trump made a clear reference to his movement, the brexit (of course much smaller) and populist movements in europe. he is just pouting words vs putin's cultivating ties to the point of funding le pen's party and overtly supporting salvini's in italy while pushing political, and not only, ties with hungary's welcoming far right goverment. these and others wanting to exit the common currency and europe.<br/>the reiteration of support to nato by trump's surrogates in munich is a minuscule fig leaf compared to the clear intent by trump/putin for the disintegration of the eu. <S_SEP> dear mr. leonhardt,<br/><br/>how about some nyt comment on tha amazingly stupid and aggressive strategy the "eu-leaders" are intending to pursue towards their nato partner, the uk?<br/><br/>marine le pen's comments have been eminently sensible and show that the people who control the "eu" are the real exteremists and that it always was a really stupid idea to be in the "eu".
our republic ,our democracy, is in grave trouble . <S_SEP> i agree, drspock, and i've been saying it since the nixon administration. if we don't do something, and do it soon, our democracy is doomed.
democrats are really really good at circular firing squads and blaming their fellow victims.<br/><br/>but you are just an provocateur, stirring the pot. <S_SEP> blaming the victim?
lock him up! lock him up! <S_SEP> lock. him. up.
"mom, jimmy set the house on fire!"<br/>"why, you nasty little tattletale! who told you that?"<br/>"but, mom ..."<br/>"i want to know who told you such a terrible lie about jimmy!"<br/>"but, mom ... the house is burning down!" <S_SEP> my childhood finally makes sense.<br/><br/>"mom, david is setting the garage on fire."<br/><br/>"no one likes a tattle-tale, son."<br/><br/>apparently mom was a republican.
i fail to understand why a very thorough background check isn't required prior to throwing your hat in the ring. business,personal, financial. everyone going to work in the white house is required to undergo a background check and several have already been fired and escorted out after the results are in. i expected the voters to reject someone with multiple bankruptcies, 3500 lawsuits filed against him, a fraudulent university and multiple sexual assault complaints. but apparently none of that mattered and look where we are now. an independent agency conducting the search, including requiring tax returns, would have saved us from a lot of misery. <S_SEP> as a doctor i was subjected to numerous background checks. my wife, a police officer, underwent the same scrutiny. why shouldn't the leader of the free world be subjected to the same standards?
it's a huge red flag. it's not a red herring. <S_SEP> not a red herring. a yuge red flag.
after reading this piece and the accompanying comments, i can't seem to get the smell of cheese out off my nose. is it just me or is something smelling rotten? this happened once before, back in "71" or "72". <S_SEP> i smell rotten borscht
$$Other comments.$$ , russia and trump's people what i find perplexing is why the trump campaign officials (at least 6) bothered communicating in the first place. i find nothing to be gained by trump's campaign. and which party initiated the contacts, russia or trump's people?<br/><br/>could it be as simple as ignorant and inexperienced campaign officials? that's the conclusion that i keep reaching. just look at how they operate now that they're in charge! <S_SEP> trump's main problem right now: he cannot be given the benefit of the doubt on anything related to russia. he praises putin, bad mouths the us, and asks russia to hack trump's political opponent. maybe there is nothing there, but the stakes are too high merely to assume that trump's denials should end the matter, especially where so many previous russia-related denials have proven to be false. <br/><br/>if trump wants to get in front of this he can do what nixon's white house did: appoint a respected special prosecutor to investigate and give the person free range. nixon went with archibald cox. nixon said there was nothing there, but it turned out that there was something there. when cox got too close nixon fired cox a politically odious event which really got the snowball roilling against the self-proclaimed non-crook. trump has the ability to prove that "there" is truly an empty place.<br/><br/>trump: appoint a special prosecutor, you can even have firing privilege if he/she gets too close to something. <S_SEP> i find these stories amusing. obama's own intelligence chief said there is zero evidence of collusion. the fbi states they found nothing.<br/>keep it up nick, your whole fantasy has not a single fact. the dots lead nowhere and your complimenting the former british agent steele doesn't change the fact that his narrative had huge wholes in it and is considered garbage by the intelligence community. <S_SEP> if richard nixon and bill clinton's<br/>indiscretions warranted special<br/>prosecutor's; surely foreign interference<br/>in our election would call for one, no? <S_SEP> i'm for the leakers, patriotic or otherwise.<br/>dump the dirt on trump so we have legal recourse to dump trump. <S_SEP> the fourth and flimsiest idea, that flimsily dressed seasoned concubines engaged in a trip-x scene with trump, before he was a candidate, and topped off their paid-for-party with their warm good-bye specialty from the 'euro-nation" (that's a pun) is likely the unseemly infantile truth.<br/><br/>trump is not the first rich person to throw away money on sexual intimacy in a foreign country far from home, in a hotel where sexual dalliance is arranged via room-service keyword request.<br/><br/>we have to assume the tapes exist and their publication would end trump's presidency on an 'ms. demean her,' besides doing reverse wonders for his trump hotel brand.<br/><br/>understandably, newspapers of record don't want to go down this trip-x path. <br/><br/>when the north korean bed-wetting despot gets his copy of trump with the russian women, kim will be ready to launch atomic warhead ballistic missiles, with an advance backwater understanding that upon the north korean's launch, that might, in fact, incinerate our west coast, we either sue the north korean for peace or the trump tapes go to you-tube.<br/><br/>we don't need to see these tapes. but the press could locate and interview the british agent who gathered the material.<br/><br/><a href="http://michaelslevinson.com" title="http://michaelslevinson.com" target="_blank">http://michaelslevinson.com</a> <S_SEP> hello, nicholas,<br/><br/>no matter how you draw the dots or connect (or disconnect) them, the fact remains that there appears to be nothing that non-trump-voters can do about it. donald trump is selling our water, air, minerals, oil, land to the highest bidders with inside tracks who will profit him personally. donald is cheater-in-chief and proud of it.<br/><br/>we know what the problem are. what we apparently don't have a clue about is the solutions.<br/><br/>obama and the clintons left the democratic party in a mess when they left office - out of touch with much of the country and with many voters. obama's touted "economic revoery" was the smallest and took the longet of any "recovery" in american history (chart i saw today from the investment company, edward jones). the recovery left millions of people out and left more much poorer than before the crash. in the meantime, obama congratulated himself and played lofty professor to their ignorance and poverty. read hillbilly ellegy. <br/><br/>donald trump is just the top of the volcano - he could blow any time and burn the rest of us. the base of the volcano is made up of millions of angry, poorly educated people, who are fed up with citizens united and can't tell that trump is the ultimate money-is-power politician-for-purchase. our problem is trump voters, who will remain. trump will pass - sooner or later. <S_SEP> , hrc, russia and gop, election rigging the chickens are coming home to roost and will aid trump in laying even more eggs than usual.<br/><br/>i repeat again as in over months:<br/>trump ran for president - a great surprise to many.<br/>he did so because he knew he could/would win.<br/>his entire outrageous and offensive campaign, his demeaning attitude toward many groups of persons, and his blatant over-confidence/swagger were possible because he knew he could/would win. <br/><br/>the election is"rigged" he said.<br/>yes - for himself and not for hrc.<br/>he implied the "rigging" for her more than once.<br/>he and overt/covert operatives may know this to be the true case for him. <br/><br/>the main task is to find who they are and who they represented.<br/>who did it? russia or gop or trump or two of them as a combination or all of them together as one determined "400 lb. unit - sitting on a bed" of their own making. <br/><br/>why was trump so determined to ignore, drop, slide over the entire issue of the hacking of pre-election elements - the dnc for one.<br/><br/>to be considered is the hacking of the election in the compilation of the voting results received from all of the states.<br/>meeting predetermined results is possible in the computer software system designed to compile the final voting results in the aggregate.<br/>77,000 votes spread over 3 states - is computer manipulation child's play. <br/><br/> can this act be labeled high crimes or misdemeanors or treason?<br/>sweep the 2018 elections and impeach trump in the house.<br/>it couldn't happen to a more deserving guy ..... or plant. <S_SEP> follow the money! who got paid, how they got paid, where they got paid and who paid them are key questions that need answers. <S_SEP> come on, mr. rosenstein: truth, justice, and the american way! <S_SEP> any hard evidence of collusion should result in:<br/><br/>1) immediate steps to remove anyone associated with dt's fraudulent election<br/>2) immediate steps to set up a special election for president<br/>3) immediate removal of any and all judges nominated by dt<br/><br/>my hunch is the gop will not agree to any of this and that the removal of dt will only be the beginning to an even larger constitutional crisis laid out by an utterly corrupt gop. <S_SEP> trump is no traitor. he is an amoral narcissistic kleptomaniac- way easier for putin to manipulate. the effect is much the same however. a weakened america, abroad and at home. <S_SEP> i vote for the financial angle combined with the brutal, pseudo-macho dictator angle. trump could care less about suffering in ukraine or syria, and knows nothing substantive about either conflict. he only cares about his money and personal power.when is someone going to leak his tax returns? <S_SEP> the russians patiently work to destroy our political and social system from the outside, while mitch mcconnell and the gop impatiently work to destroy us from the inside. <S_SEP> the most interesting part about this to me is that even if all of this was figured out and made public i suspect trump will still get reelected<br/><br/>the most accurate thing he said during the campaign was his comment that he could shoot someone on 5th avenue and it wouldn't matter<br/><br/>the best shot the democrats may have in dethroning trump maybe to find an even larger than life character. <br/><br/>maybe run tom hanks. it seems the majority of the electorate in many states cares more about shiny objects than self preservation. <S_SEP> you're right about the severity of trump's assault on america and what his russian ties threaten. six russians have experienced unexpected deaths; four of them were thought to be associated with the russian dossier on trump. u.s. intelligence agencies have confirmed some of the element in the dossier. what more will come out? <a

audit of his taxes. <S_SEP> in the spirit of a typical ny times headline:<br/><br/>nicholas christoff accuses trump of colluding with russians, but offers no evidence. <S_SEP> my name is donald trump.<br/>you see, i can utter a complete sentence without lying.-<br/>#realdonaldtrumpfakepresident <S_SEP> if "he" is general flynn, you are in, but if "he" is trump, you can drop the fake news. no one's got him on tape except the russians <S_SEP> i guess when clapper (obama guy) says no evidence, idiot kristof insists otherwise. lots of mentally deranged lunatics in the newspaper.<br/><br/>nick, go connect the hillary dots to pay-for-play and uranium or obama to tony rezcko bribes. those things actually happened.<br/><br/>facts. try them on for size and not rehashed smoke you lefties started and blew towards the right. <S_SEP> yes. and don't forget rex tillerson as secretary of state. gives me chills. <S_SEP> what part of "needing a court order" do you not understand? <S_SEP> it's not too late to see his tax returns. the media owes it to the public to reveal what goes on behind closed doors in washington, d.c. after all, the government's job is to protect its citizens. if trump's income and other business dealings have indeed been with russia, and the election hack is connected to that, the american people need to know and congress must act on it. <S_SEP> trump said jon huntsman gave usa to china.<br/><br/>now trump nominates huntsman to give remain to russia. <S_SEP> trump's tweets and public comments (=lies) will help to do him in. they already have when the courts have looked at the muslim ban. <S_SEP> anyone who knows trump, like many of we new yorkers do. knows nothing is beyond his scruples. he's a deeply troubled individual. <br/><br/>trump has always loved the limelight. he did his earnest to be accepted by the poobahs here. but ever since he arrived from queens, he's always been seen for what he is, a complete buffoon, a walking talking joke, always so full of himself. trump carried a chip on his shoulder throughout his career. if trump's name was plastered on a building, it was persona non grata to most natives. only touristas and rubes who knew trump from his selling of schlock thought trump a class act. he never was. <br/><br/>when things went bust for his company, trump was reduced to selling pizza for pizza hut and burgers for burger king. then he realized he could put the trump brand on products made in sweat shops and charge a premium price to gullible types who didn't know better. <br/><br/>trump, to folks in flyover country, has always held a fascination. he's been a person they look at in admiration, the man who has everything. it is a facade, a canard, but they want to believe. <br/><br/>trump is a poor person's idea of a rich person. among his colleagues here, trump is a known commodity. class has never been mentioned in the same sentence with trump. he was, is, and will be always known as the kid from queens, a manhattan wannabe. an also ran, trump was never in the running.<br/><br/>dd<br/>manhattan <S_SEP> it is an absolute pleasure to watch the left become unglued! the left is completely and clinically insane, chasing these bizarre, fact-free, unhinged, crazed conspiracy theories that have zero basis in fact <S_SEP> this is really scary. don't forget he fired all the ambassadors as of jan 20. how many have been replaced? if there is a crisis in a country overseas, who is running the show, protecting our staff, and our civilians in the country. part of the evacuation plans are in the 37% budget cut. <S_SEP> , ukraine affair, fbi, foreign hold over government we were the victims of a coup, and the fbi and the congress should be investigating how and why it happened.<br/>anyone in congress who does not reveal the extent of the foreign hold over our government should resign in disgrace.<br/>anyone in the white house or cabinet who is shown to have any connection to russia should be immediately dismissed, or removed under amendment 25.<br/>the life of our country is at stake. <S_SEP> after seeing how trump has behaved in his pre-candidate life, during the campaign, and in the first month of his so-called "presidency", i would not encourage anyone to dismiss any nefarious thing that this man has done. <S_SEP> given hillary's campaign also had numerous interactions with russian officials, are we not to conclude that she was also conspiring with the russians? <S_SEP> one can surmise by the many reports about trump's management style that he was a micro-manager. he had a very lean organization allowing him to manage minute details about the operation. he also built a culture that was based on loyalty and taking huge risks. why do we think he would have conducted his campaign for president in any other way? he would have made it his business to know what was happening in his campaign. i am certain that the people around him would have known about how he felt about loyalty. but, let us assume he did not know what was happening in his campaign. that is worse? can we trust him to manage a bureaucracy like the federal government? <S_SEP> the intel agencies no doubt have the goods on trump and his russian co-conspirators. they must disclose all the evidence asap before the deranged ego-maniac in chief launches a nuke attack on iran or n. korea to distract the nation from his impeachable crimes. <S_SEP> hillary's second biggest mistake: trying to beat the system with her private email server.<br/>dnc's second biggest mistake: having sloppy cybersecurity. <S_SEP> we would have to shake the toxic partisanship and agree that having another nation undermine our elective process is a bad thing, even if the majority of elected leaders benefited from it. <br/><br/>david brooks wrote today that we are lacking a narrative, a compelling story that unites generations. well, maybe this is part of the reason. what shining mythos do you develop that encompasses the idea that russian interference is bad if it helps them but ok if it helps us?<br/><br/>whatever ensues will be paltry, because the majority of our government doesn't want to take the risk that underneath the smoke there might be a fire, however small or large it could be. <br/><br/>i don't actually believe that the trump campaign conspired with the russians. i believe they made overtures, had inappropriate conversations that could amount to promises. but likely the russians chose which side and tossed a few grenades as an assist independently. but our fragile ego in chief couldn't handle even that conclusion, nor can our congress who recognize that their power rests more on gerrymander skullduggery than overweening voter support. <S_SEP> regarding #8... the real estate downturn was in 2008 --- when all that russian money was coming in for trump. hmmm... maybe the russians saved trump from disaster and now he owes them? we should think about how russian organized crime might be involved too. <S_SEP> i knew it. trump's on drugs! rumor has it that during the campaign he took 500mg of vladsa-pala-mine every day for over a year. it helped him win the election. sounds like he's still using. <S_SEP> not only should his tax returns be investgated publicly, but this should include somw forensic accounting. someone in russia owns him. this is a man who can't condemn anything that the russian government does.<br/>again, somebody owns him. <S_SEP> thank you. these folks need to hear from millions of us. and let's hope mr. steele stays safe.<br/><a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russia-diplomats-deaths-theories-putin-kremlin-a7602201.html"

exxon-mobil and the russian oil company about developing oil wells in the artic. look at who is secretary of state.... <S_SEP> to the tune of " matchmaker, matchmaker" from fiddler on the roof. <br/><br/> tax cheater, tax cheater<br/> show us the forms<br/> just put them them out there<br/> conform to the norms<br/><br/> tax cheater, tax cheater<br/> why, why deny<br/> we need to know<br/> why continue to lie<br/><br/> tax cheater, tax cheater<br/> why shouldn't you pay<br/> a fair share is good<br/> just why won't you say <S_SEP> in democracies with a parliamentary system of government, he would be out already. <S_SEP> it is incredible that the republicans are so brazen in focusing on condemning individuals who report a crime rather than those who commit the crime. regardless of other issues, that attitude alone indicates that an independent investigation is needed. all americans, and even residents of other countries who have had great respect for the us, such as myself, should insist that any challenge to democratic principles be met with a full independent inquiry. <S_SEP> , hate crime this is a very concise, thorough piece of all the reasons we need to investigate further, but there is already ground for legal action that is proceeding and in the last, fifth, or final possible motive, that as you shared "could be the most alarming", you failed to mention that not only was his inaugural speech noted as pro "white, christian-infused nationalism", it also was bearing allegiance to a whole different america than i live in, which his supporters are a fan of. this is why it is important to move this investigation along in a timely fashion, as this allegiance with russian like ideology versus more than two thirds of our country, by our president is dangerous to all who oppose him, as we are already experiencing a rise in hate crimes and anti everything but one's personal needs being met. this is not america and it certainly is not christian, with thousands of references in the bible to caring for the alien, wayfarer, stranger, not your usual neighbor. <S_SEP> , bribery, corruption the trump administration should instead of the colossal military budget increases direct that money into the fbi budget.<br/><br/>the fbi just doesn’t have enough resources and agents to run all the urgently needed investigations crucial to the national security.<br/><br/>we live in the era of the credit cards. it means it’s stupid to believe that the money has to be received before the incriminating acts in order to prove the corruption and bribery. the hush money could exchange the hands after the elected official leaves the office and everything is perfectly legal while the colossal damages are inflicted upon america.<br/><br/>the fbi has to investigate all the lavish donations not from the foreign governments because that would be too obvious but from the global corporations to the us politicians after they left the office. everybody knows the ex-leaders get the hefty financial rewards through the prosaically foolish explanations like the outrageous speaking fees, the book allowances, donations to the humanitarian organization or the corporate boards seats for them or the close family members.<br/><br/>let’s have a look at george w. bush, for example. <br/><br/>after the 9/11/2001 (as the ex-texas businessman with the heavy oil background and the saudi business ties) in spite of receiving the intelligence data indicating that the attackers, leaders, and financiers were the saudi and egyptian citizens he ordered the invasions of afghanistan and iraq, thus costing america several trillion dollars.. <S_SEP> @pamom: <br/><br/>i have been dismayed by many things, i do not believe he should be tweeting. he's impulsive and narcissistic. but he also has some good points...but the media and e left never give him a chance. look at the times. they are obsessed with trump. after decades as a loyal subscriber, am seriously thinking of cancelling my subscription. there's just not much to read anymore beyond the trump-trashing articles. <br/><br/>hillary is a bigger crook. look at that corrupt clinton foundation, how she ran her campaign and the illegal email server. <S_SEP> i wonder if president obama may consider suing donald trump for his false accusations regarding the wire tapping of trump tower?<br/><br/>i think he would have a solid lawsuit and we all know trump loves to settle out of court rather than the publicity of just outright losing. <S_SEP> we need a new election. like europe six week campaign. vote. <S_SEP> as craig (queens, n.y.) makes clear, there must be an independent investigation that earns public trust. steele emerges as a credible source whose findings are essential to any serious inquiry. <S_SEP> well is it a felony or isn't it? are you saying that the laws are bad then? i'd be surprised if it wasn't classified, since every other thing seems to be "classified". basing the enforcement of our laws on a classification status set by our intelligence agencies seems to put a lot of power in the hands of non-elected and secretive officials. <S_SEP> it's easy to connect the dots already. heck there is a straight line that has already emerged, unless one is apt to believe the cavalcade of ''coincidences'' that are already fact. <br/><br/>having said that, democrats can demand hearings until they are blue in the face, but republicans have no shame. they are too busy falling all over themselves to enact the ''agenda'' before they even think of looking inward. that agenda being the triumvirate of getting scotus filled with ideologue(s), enacting a top down budget cut and repealing health care. <br/><br/>even if all that is achieved and the slow grind of hearings begin, the press ( aided by republicans of course ) will continue with the false equivalency narrative which plagues the 4th estate, and contributed mightily to getting this administration voted for in the first place. <br/><br/>it's like moving molasses up a hill with a teaspoon . <S_SEP> the only thing "haunting" here is the ghost of things that didn't happen, even though the times wished they had. <S_SEP> trump's team thinking it would be "impolite" not to respond......<br/><br/>really? impolite? when have you seen some example of politesse<br/>from that campaign? <S_SEP> and let's add this to the state department dot: a sec of state with zero fp experience, and yet very close ties to russia. an employee of a company all americans should look at with healthy skepticism, who has serious bank to gain if they can move forward on a exxon-russiaa oil deal. <S_SEP> it's all about oil -- it always is.<br/><br/>when putin heard trump say that our chief failing in invading iraq was that "we should have just taken the oil," i bet his tiny ex-kgb heart skipped a beat. finally, here was someone in the us who didn't pay lip-service to the ideas of spreading democracy and nation-building in the middle east. here was someone who spoke his language, who bluntly advocated that the us should have acted like the kleptocratic, extortionist, petro-dictatorship that putin had worked so hard to build in russia. <br/><br/>the russian state physically hovers over every oil-producing kingdom, sheikdom or what-have-you in the middle east, and putin would probably love nothing better than to extend its reach into every one of those oil fields and pipelines and extract those foreign resources for russia's own global profits (like the us and the cia intervened to prop up the shah of iran and the house of saud through the 50s, 60s and 70s). and to have the us led by someone who wouldn't at least pretend that we were only committed to democratic ideals -- well, i'm sure putin would have done anything to back trump after that. <S_SEP> too bad this can’t be an investigation of the donations received by the clinton foundation while hillary clinton was supposedly the secretary of state, which amounted to no less than bribes for political favor and access. thank you. <S_SEP> dear representatives and senators:<br/>investigative obfuscation of treason is a treasonable offense and enabling criminals taints you with their crime.<br/>beware your awoken voters, may they hold you responsible for your acts and your inaction. <S_SEP> however this slow-motion disaster ends, most americans will have learned some important lessons. now we know how important it is that we participate in elections, do our homework, talk to others in our community and most important, vote. one-third of all eligible voters, 75 million of us, did not vote in 2016. trump's 62 million votes represent fewer than one-third of all voters, only 24.8%. maybe we should consider an amendment making voting mandatory? <S_SEP> it seems the russians have been grooming many members of the republican party for the past 8 years. <br/><br/>it is surprising how so many gop lemmings willingly will throw us all off the cliff so that they can maintain power and keep their donors happy<br/><br/>take their flag pins away. they are all frauds <S_SEP> , russia and u.s. election james clapper said there was no evidence of trump team collaboration with russians. he did not say that ongoing investigations would not produce evidence. he also did not say that the numerous trump officials who met with russian operatives and even lied about it under oath was not suspicious, a matter worthy of investigation and possibly punishment. he did not say america would be better off not knowing the truth.<br/><br/>clapper also did not address the question of whether the leaks constituted justifiable whistle-blowing. <S_SEP> if there is any "veiled agenda" at work here, it's the one that got this man into office, and is now doing its utmost to keep him there.<br/>another thing.<br/>this "president" wasn't "duly elected" like you think -- he was selected by the vastly outdated electoral college.<br/>he lost the majority by 3 million votes.<br/>the democracy is in the math. <S_SEP> the new russo-american empire. solidarity with white christian biker gangs against islamic fundamentalist terrorists. what a crummy way to end the world. <S_SEP> i agree that foreigners should not influence american elections. no campaign funds or political contributions should be allowed from non-us citizens. the united states should also refrain from influencing elections in other countries. the penalties should be reasonably severe.<br/><br/>now try to enforce this, especially the latter part. the united states has worked to influence elections and political movements around the world. it has always had favored candidates in foreign elections and has found ways, overt and covert, to help them.<br/><br/>a classic present-day example of this is israel. israeli citizens are prime players in american elections, and vice-versa. many enjoy "dual citizenship," a diversionary way around this issue. millions of dollars are contributed to israel-friendly candidates in the united states by israelis, primarily to the democratic party. i think this should be stopped along with all of the other examples from russia to the people's republic of china to mexico and to every other country in the world. illegal immigrants taking part in our political process should be immediately deported, including those involved in advocacy groups. no foreign influence!<br/><br/>this should also apply to "in-kind" contributions, such as participating in voter registration drives, taking part in political rallies, sending money to relatives overseas to donate, and a myriad of other ways to influence politics in countries not their own. <br/><br/>singling out the russians is not enough. <S_SEP> no question that "sessions seems a red herring," but when the attorney general fails to disclose meetings with the russian ambassador during his confirmation hearings, americans deserve a full explanation as to why. <S_SEP> i am not yet “sick and tired of winning” as he likes to say, but i am sick and tired of him. <S_SEP> , russia and trump affair until the investigation into the possible collusion between members of the trump campaign and russia has been concluded and the results made public, the confirmation hearing of neil gorsuch should be brought to an immediate halt. <br/><br/>the legitimacy of this administration has now seriously been brought into question. <S_SEP> yes the truth will emerge just as the truth that richard nixon actively subverted peace talks with the viet namese in 1968 emerged last month. i wonder how much comfort that gave the families of american kids killed (along with many, many more asians) there from 68-72? or how many of those families are even aware of the "news"? it's time for john mccain to round up a couple of other republican senators and once more subject himself to the torture his party will inflict for putting america first. you're 80 years old and not facing re-election for 6 more years, senator. get back to your patriotic routes. secure your legacy. <S_SEP> “i will tell you this, russia: if you’re listening, i hope you’re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing,” the republican nominee said at a news conference in florida. “i think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.”<br/><br/>isn't this a big dot? a direct public invitation to the<br/>russians and a blatant directive to the<br/>trump circle to coordinate with the russians. <S_SEP> dear mr. leonhardt,<br/><br/>if you are concerned about foreigners meddling, then you might like to investigate claims of the usa meddling in the uk, resulting in us being prisoners of the "eu" for over 43 years and paying, at today's prices, billions each year to an organisation which is not merely totally useless but is mega-destructive.<br/><br/>fairly recently it was reported that obama had advised cameron not to give us a referendum on "membership" of the "eu". if that is true, then it shows a complete lack of understanding as to the consequences of that, given that we had already been denied a promised referendum by blair.<br/><br/>and then there is the reported attempt by goldman-sachs to influence the brexit referendum etc.<br/><br/>please investigate these matters. <S_SEP> maybe i'm too old -- i remember the watergate saga so well. there was an astonishing new revelation every day. but as sinister as nixon was, there seemed to be a certain logic in his thinking and actions. with this new administration, i see the sinister part, but not the logical part. <S_SEP> don't forget that not only did trump not make arming ukraine a campaign issue, but that idea was also mysteriously deleted from the official republican platform at the convention. there has never been a sufficient explanation about who took it out. <S_SEP> so you're a trump supporter and blind to reality, we get it. so don't read the nyt, the truth will only infuriate you. <S_SEP> well said, mr. leonhardt, but this "... strange case of russophilia ..." you discern will be outed, if at all, by the aggressive inquisitiveness of hard working journalists and their bosses in the newspaper business. television news can't and won't do the scut work necessary to develop confidential sources and organize protracted story lines. parenthetically, an exception, if any, might be wgbh-tv's "frontline" program. "might" is the operative word in the preceding sentence. <br/><br/>trump's russophilia will be outed, if at all, by a newspaper that has the leadership, will, and resources to investigate leads, develop reliable sources, and produce timely stories that hold up under the most intense ... underscore "most intense" ... denials and blowback the administration and its crony "news" organizations can muster. <br/><br/>woodward and bernstein wrote the playbook for rooting out the truth about crooked political shenanigans at the highest levels of government. it's now up to today's editors and reporters to draw back the curtains concealing the secrecy, conspiracy, intrigue, and just plain lying (that may be ... appears to be) going on in the highest levels of the current presidential administration.<br/><br/>get it on. <S_SEP> we're so divided as a nation right now that even if concrete evidence proving that trump colluded with russia emerges his supporters will chalk it up to a left wing conspiracy to end his presidency. there will be no winners in the war to save our country. <S_SEP> since last july. holy moses. if comey wants to see this thing through in such a way as to defend his own integrity and that of the bureau, he should start by acknowledging that his actions very likely blew up the election. i mean, if we had any doubt about the effects of what he *did* say last october, it's a no-brainer in conjunction with what we now know he chose to *not* say. she would most certainly, and rightly, be the president - and we would have a legitimate president - if he'd either told the whole story, or just kept quiet. he doesn't seem like a stupid person. i hope he thinks about the sheer scale of the effects of his actions, because that realization should be the basis of his every move going forward. <S_SEP> "the other big statement clapper made last sunday, which was: no evidence of collusion between trump and putin was found."....which should not be taken to imply that the russian did not try. the purpose of an investigation should be to find out what the russian were doing and how they were trying to influence outcomes. <S_SEP> trump always talked about his admiration for richard nixon, now he has a lot more in common with him then he could have ever dreamed. <S_SEP> i am not an attorney. but common sense would say that when a sitting government official, especially the president, accuses a former government official, in this case also a president, of a felony one of two things is true. if it's true then isn't it a treasonous leak of the sort the president is accusing others of? and if it's false if not a crime it is certainly defamatory and libelous. when does trump answer for his indiscriminate use of twitter legally? like i said. i am not an attorney. <S_SEP> trump bought it for $40 million and sold it to rybolovlev, the "fertilizer king", for $100 million. trump therefore reaps a profit of $60 million. rybolovlev is a russian oligarch and in putin's circle. <S_SEP> a surprisingly balanced and fair tone and approach to a maddeningly confusing legal and political issue with enormous diplomatic and historical implications going forward. kudos to the editorial board for getting it right this time, but query if the bipartisan approach envisioned by the editorial is even feasible in today's superheated, unduly partisan political environment. our leadership culture is so saturated with trumpian divisiveness at the moment. i yearn for the distance of years from this crisis. but i wonder if any of us will survive to see a better day for america. <br/><br/>perhaps that vaunted "bipartisan team of statesmen" (and women) the times calls for exists, but i frankly doubt it can be found within today's corrupted washington. <S_SEP> all i ask is that they think ahead of trump and his antics and get the job done!! we need him gone. i know the alternatives to trump are not good but at least they are not sleeping with putin. sigh. how sad that our government has come to this. <S_SEP> trump has always operated as if rules, rules of any kind, do not apply to him. he colluded with russia. he's a money laundering instrument of russian oligarchs. and who knows what else... <br/><br/>his only interest is in his own self-aggrandizement. <S_SEP> i'll be surprised if trump doesn't have sleepless nights. of course he has to put on a show. i bet he worries more about his business than the country, and may regret running for the election.<br/>we all know trump's business dealings with russia - his son donald jr. confirmed them in 2008 - but we don't know about their nature. apart from borrowing heavily, some of his companies - according to reports - may have been involved in money-laundering. if russians close to the kremlin had a huge stake in his business, they wouldn't mind to help him win the election, as he would scrap sanctions. russian stock market jumped after his election.<br/>even now the kremlin is still keen on keeping trump in power, because it won't gain from his departure - unless he hurts russian interests. yet he fears being removed from office, because he may lose his brand and the money tied to it. he would also have to repay the loans to lenders, leaving him probably poorer.<br/>it may be the explanation for his determination to fight any investigation into his ties to russia, and the gop-led congress seems unconcerned, deeming partisan politics more important than patriotism. it's up to concerned americans to learn the truth, after all trump's legitimacy is questionable and he is totally unfit for the office. <S_SEP> truly history is repeating itself. back in the late 1940's and into the 1950's republicans and weak-willed democrats led by senator mccarthy were hyping the "red scare" accusing various government officials and private citizens of being russian/communist sympathizers. now we have the democrats and weak-willed republicans going down the same road pointing fingers at members of the executive branch and private citizens of being agents of the kremlin all in the name of saving our democracy. i cannot wait for the televised congressional hearings wherein committee members will grill individuals whether they have been or were ever in contact vladimir putin or any russian official. naturally, a blacklist is to follow based upon supposition and innuendo barring certain persons of employment opportunities. who will be today's alger hiss?<br/><br/>i have no love for donald trump or any of his minions. however, i equally despise any politician or party who looks to blemish a person's reputation in an effort to uncover a fathom boogie man hoping to secure some political advantage - mccarthyism redux. we are better than that! <S_SEP> i understand that he isn't on trial, but why did no one ask comey why he stated that he is now responsive to the department of justice when he ignored loretta lynch's request to not violate protocol by announcing a renewed investigation into clinton's emails? were they being gracious and polite because of his imposing stature and stateliness/humorous combo (talking about hating the patriots and chuckling while explaining that it was because they were so darn talented)? wasn't part of today's hearing to establish confidence in these investigations? the meekness on display today was extremely dispiriting to me. <S_SEP> have you forgotten about the son in law, jared kushner meeting with the russians in december? <br/><br/>and, as always, follow the money. <S_SEP> the framers of the constitution did not foresee a time when a mock celebrity with no government experience and no real connection to people who value honesty and integrity would run for president on a lark, gain surprising populist support, draw unvetted opportunists into his inner circle, gain the support of a political party willing to sacrifice its own principles and win both the election and a majority in congress. the ragtag team of greedy unprincipled white men that trump has surrounded himself with undoubtedly have more to hide than we will ever know. and the same can be said for the political party that supports him. <S_SEP> if trump &amp; his republican supporters block the effort to have an independent prosecutor , it would be tantamount to admitting their guilt,if this comes to be ,where do we go from here ? what are the options for americans that want to keep our democracy ? <S_SEP> anyone interested in learning more about the murky, if not criminal, business dealings of trump and his family should read a very well researched article published in this week's new yorker. the article begs two questions: why trump continues to get away with decades of bad acts; and why responsible print media appear inclined to avoid probing events that indicate a troubling repetition of worrisome conduct.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal" title="http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal" target="_blank">http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/03/13/donald-trumps-worst-deal</a> <S_SEP> , gold price, russia and usa follow the gold.<br/>while bitcoins are popular hotties for the putin's global laundry service, gold is quietly being manipulated by tje western oligarchs and their banker goldman sachs.<br/>gold is produced in canada and australia and elsewhere. the almighty us dollar was beginning to slide despite the federal reserve's hint that interest rates would rise this month. since the beginning of march, however, the dollar has shot up in relation to the currencies of both goldman-connected gold mine countries. even as oil price has stabilized and canada's economy looks a heck of a lot more healthy than its "rich" uncle down south. why?<br/>if i were an koch-level investor in trump and i saw lots of ugly dots start to line up into a big pixel attack upon the oval office and nuclear-laden russia, i would want to buy as much gold as i could at a "specially" discounted banker-driven price. russia of course is another gold producer.<br/>when wiki-leaks dumps trump's business papers and tax returns and campaign conversations held in the same vaults now spilling out, buy gold. <S_SEP> some days i get caught in the deepest worry that our country and its ideals are now past tense - all because of trump and friends. then i think, how could this be - how can one man and many millions of deluded, selfish followers take down the free world without a shot? the destruction of government agencies is smart if your goal is to take down democracy. joining hands with russia, putin and oligarchs around the world is smart if your goal is to take down democracy. god almighty. <S_SEP> russia vs usa<br/>round 1 - putin vs clinton - goal - delegitimitize the incoming clinton presidential administration. result - putin 1, usa 0<br/>round 2 - putin vs trump - goal - delegitmitize the trump presidential administration. result, putin 2, usa 0<br/>round 3 - putin vs usa - ? <S_SEP> , trump and putin david, it is an undeniable fact that trump and putin are of one soul with 2 bodies.<br/><br/>beside their white color of the skin, both have the mentalities that correspond with one another.<br/><br/>both of them are now presidents of two super powers who came to power with white judeo-christian nationalistic hubris. <br/><br/>both supposedly hate muslims but don't mind breaking bread with the ruthless arab leaders after their ending of ramadan. <br/><br/>putin breaks bread with assad and iran's leaders. <br/><br/>trump breaks bread with the very sadistic rulers of this world who also happened to be bush's partners in blowing up our twin towers and a part of the pentagon.<br/><br/>yes, i'm talking about saudi arabia from where 16 of the 19 hijackers came and feted and dined and wined by the saudi embassy officials before they killed 4,000+ of our beautiful civilian souls beside our losing of 8,000+ of our fantastic and the world's best brave men and women in the subsequent useless wars in afghanistan and iraq.<br/><br/>trump is ignoring all the facts given in the now declassified 'congressional report on 9/11' which i read along with millions of our fellow citizens beside probably more than a billion people all over the world.<br/><br/>that report clearly stated the facts about the roles that the saudi officials as well as officials from egyptian,lebanon and u.a.e. embassies played where 16+3 of the hijackers came from.<br/><br/>so my question now, "is our foreign policies be dictated by where trump has hotels, casinos and resorts ?"<br/><br/>you figure. <S_SEP> one of those dots that needs the bight light of day shown upon it is cambridge analytics. after kushner met with them did he pass the keys to the kingdom to russia? why is no one investigating robert mercer and his connection with bannon? <S_SEP> my frustration is with the scores of so-called "conservatives" who are always willing to believe the most far-fetched and bizarre conspiracy theories about democrats but seem to have no concern whatsoever with the increasing evidence regarding russia and trump. <S_SEP> "the trump administration, which has shown a proclivity to lie,"<br/><br/>thank you for using the word "lie." <S_SEP> , testimony there has long been (purportedly) close cooperation between american and british intelligence. wouldn't the cia and possibly fbi have interviewed the mi6 guy, christopher steele by now? if i remember correctly, some (probably anonymous) cia sources vouched for this guy's reputation and credibility. and what about the famous dossier? certainly it could be subpoenaed and steele could be asked to testify in front of (dare i dream it?) a special commission or real congressional hearings. help us, obewan.<br/>kristof’s dots are all good to note (except for #10, which isn’t really an evidence dot). i’d like to see a running compilation of all the evidence dots, as they emerge, so that the connections are so obvious they cannot be ignored. <S_SEP> joe mccarthy couldn't connect the dots either, but he destroyed the lives of a lot of people before he was finally neutered.<br/><br/>there was also nothing illegal about schumer, pelosi and mccaskill interacting with the russian ambassador, but they forgot about those encounters until the record proved they "misstated" the truth. <S_SEP> you said it. we have great statespeople among the democrats. stand up for truth and honor, men and women of the democratic party! speak loud and clear. you will be perceived as partisan only by those who are too foolish to realize freedom and justice are at stake. and i don't mean just in this nation, but around the world. <S_SEP> exactly. the expert who compiled the dossier is one of the most respected russian experts in the uk with years of experience. much has been verified by other intelligence experts. even the sex tape is not out of character from all of his boasts across the years and his patterns. <S_SEP> i don't feel they are closely linked. the contents of the emails were boring at best, politics as usual, the story there was where the "leak" came from. <br/><br/>now, the story is trump and team collusion with russia. without leaks, we wouldn't know there was a trump and team collusion with russia.<br/><br/>you are comparing apples and oranges. one leak was a crime against someone, the other leak was about a crime committed. i'm much more interested in the crime committed, as we all should be. <S_SEP> the republican senate won't do it's job. they wallow intrumps lies. it doesn't take political experts to determine what trump is up to. congratulations, all you wonderful conservatives! <S_SEP> "..... it will be left for patriotic leakers, and journalists, to make sure the truth comes out." gee. could this have anything to do with why he's trying to convince us all that the media is the enemy of the people? if we believe that, then we won't believe anything we read in the news. it will all be "fake." the right will claim that all those outraged on the left are just being sore losers. the left will be marching in the streets, but so what? so long as republicans hold both houses of congress, we will be spinning our wheels and getting nowhere.<br/><br/>this is a coup. <S_SEP> i just learned president trump has knowingly laundered trillions of dollars for putin and russian oligarchs. very bad (or sick) guy.<br/><br/>i'd expect you to ask me for proof? <S_SEP> what are the checks and balances for a president who has never apologized for, admitted, or understood the meaning of, wrongdoing?<br/><br/>what are the checks and balances for people who have the power to post guards at the doors to the oval office?<br/><br/>why hasn't congress acted to stop this clearly insane behaviour?<br/><br/>are they tolerating this lunatic, or using him for cover?<br/><br/>we may be at a turning point in american history.<br/><br/>have we thought this through? <S_SEP> now secretary of state tillerson has announced that he will skip the nato foreign ministers meeting but plans a trip to russia. “there’s a smell of treason in the air,” presidential historian douglas brinkley said and "exxon rex" is doing nothing to make it smell less. <S_SEP> there are two evils here, mr. leonhardt: stephen bannon and mitch mcconnell. <br/><br/>begin with the most likely fact: donald trump is a fool. he stumbled upon the presidency with an extraordinary amount of luck. his office was the result of a perfect storm of the underbelly of racism in the american experience (going back to the 1970's when he and his father forbid blacks to rent his properties to his birther campaign). he was a windsock for the far right, a natural magnet for bannon once the republican primaries got underway and became non-competitive with each trump win. it all coalesced during the gop national convention and the general election: the hollywood access tape and "lock her up" chants. he drew the forces of anarchy to himself while disparaging president obama as a "weak" leader and elevating vladimir putin as the model for state-controlled fascism: suppression of the media and minorities. bannon's fingerprints are all over this.<br/><br/>mcconnell, as senate majority leader, directs the course of that body's business. he isn't about to hazard any challenges to this president because an investigation that uncovered irrefutable evidence that trump owed russia would unpin mcconnell's promises to dark money. like a dirty thread on a doily, the mcconnell/grover norquist/koch bottle gang would be the last giveaway for the gop as it determinedly plods down the dark road toward authoritarianism. donald trump is a mere tool.<br/><br/>bannon and mcconnell know about russia. they don't care. <S_SEP> they won't be jolted. expect any effort to oust him, no matter how grounded in fact to be met by the gop nightmare of large numbers of angry old white people waving guns in the streets and carrying anti-republican signs. <S_SEP> didn't you notice cameron's father had real tax dodging investments revealed in the panama papers? do folks thin panama papers is a tv show about 1970s dope blowers? <br/><br/>why did that plot unseat a pm in the uk version allowing fu to slip inside 10 downing, but david cameron walked like he never had gchq remove the corrupting email from a suspect's cellphone that saved murdoch $2 billion in bacon, too? good morning, q. <S_SEP> 45 deserves no benefit of the doubt as far as his business interests in russia are concerned. he has not released his tax returns. we are entitled to believe that he is deeply invested in russia and with russian money.<br/>take the deeply flawed two-week old and now defunct ban on immigrants. it was directed at seven countries that had little to do with terrorism but also places where 45 had no business interests. otoh saudi arabia and egypt were excluded from that list. not only did they have a deeper connection with terrorism but those are two places where 45 has business interests.<br/>we always knew that 45 cared about one thing only - him and his business interests. he tweeted about nordstrom dropping his daughter's line of clothing. who does that? a delusional narcissist who does anything and everything to benefit himself.<br/>case closed. <S_SEP> horseshoe crab, i totally agree with you about the money. this is trump's bottom line (so to speak).<br/><br/>but i don't think so when you say: "...the ideological connection) seems increasingly plausible given trump's repeated rants (and previously flynn's) against radical islamic groups and the purported subsequent ban designed to keep said groups out, but really a thinly veiled action against muslims."<br/><br/>trump doesn't have any ideological leanings of any kind--this is not someone who thinks deeply on any subject. the islamophobia message is being fed to him by bannon and pence--and i live in dread that they are actually trying to accelerate us toward the "end times." (read (or just get a summary of) one of those "left behind" books and check out this piece: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-apocalypse_us_5898f02ee4b040613138a951" title="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-apocalypse_us_5898f02ee4b040613138a951" target="_blank">http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/steve-bannon-apocalypse_us_5898f02ee...</a>. and pence--very fundamentalist christian--is right there with him.) <S_SEP> it's obvious that we have a deranged president with serious psychological problems. these problems have been identified ad nauseam for the past two years now (attention deficit syndrome, persecution complex, endless re-playing and tweeting of tapes in his head, etc., etc). with the north korea crisis now looming, we should all be truly alarmed. this is way beyond fun and games. we also have an out-of-control leader capable of irrational actions. <S_SEP> the surveillance would be on the russians he was talking to. nobody says we don't wiretap them. <S_SEP> it is easy to get caught up in the craziness and imagine videos showing trump and putin literally in bed together, but it does no one any good. therefore, i greatly appreciate the lack of drama accompanying your list of concerns regarding potential trump-russia ties. if the country is to survive this, we have to approach these allegations apolitically, but seriously, as patriots defending liberty. <S_SEP> you should remember, then, that nixon didn't order the operation in question, and that he could have avoided everything if he had simply not tried to cover for the people who were responsible. criminals achieving high office? laughable. <S_SEP> i believe your column, and most of the anti-trump all the time msm are explained as begging the question. more clearly explained is less sat-vocabulary and advanced degree jargon. that is: you work from the position that<br/>you are right, fair, objective and trump and his "minions" are wrong, stupid, venal, treasonous, power mad et al ad infinitum. more in nyt speak. you and neo-lib &amp; cyber fauz progs pots sanctimoniously demean the neo-con, trumpsters plus faux tea party koch bros cabal kettles black.<br/>the american tragic binary delusion. nothing socially, political, economically and/or morally ever a simple matter of black or white, but rather a mandela color wheel spectrum of both black and white and all shades, saturations and hues between.<br/>and, final tangential musing: why this faux hysteria about third rate russia which shades out any mention of more important china, #2 world industrial if not yet miliatry complex, puppet master of north korea and the magic genie for american consumers in need of simple mops to apple toys of conspicuous consumption. <S_SEP> what we really need right now is a strong bipartisan voice to steer this disaster out of deep water and lead it toward an independent, non-partisan investigation. if the trump administration is innocent, then there should be no objections to putting this on the right course to find the truth. if there are objections, then they should be investigated onto themselves. obviously there should be no objections to the truth. <S_SEP> don't count on comrade comey to get at the truth. he is still sniffing for more clinton emails. <S_SEP> "if comey really wants to investigate who interfered with and changed the outcome of the 2016 u.s. presidential election, he does not have to look 4,857 miles to moscow. he should look in the mirror"<br/>--dennis kucinich <S_SEP> exactly. "the united states has never had a situation quite like this." which is all the more reason to have an independent investigation that will demand the release of #45's taxes and find out how far the hacking of the dnc's computer system affected the election. oh, and tillerson's ties and comey's role in the election (and absence of same when it comes to #45's gliding into the presidency). start it stat. if the investigation reveals treason, then hang 'em high and install the rightful president in the oval office. <S_SEP> to the silent members of the gop: all it takes for evil to prevail is for good men to do nothing. just remember that the whole world is watching you right now. with fear and disbelief. what legacy do you want history to remember you by? what are you going to tell your grand-children when they one day ask you what you did, when bannon and trump rose to power? please stand up to the craziness we all are witnessing from what used to be a country and leadership we adored and relied on. but are now terrified of. <S_SEP> members of congress are holding up rod rosenstein, nomination until they get more info from comey. let's hope today's testimony suffices; seems strange to hold-up the nominee who can call in a special prosecutor; republicans dragging their feet. ha! <S_SEP> , gop everything about the trump presidency seems straight out of the world wrestling entertainment, inc. playbook—fake. the issues are scripted. the political action choreographed, and the physical impact to the american public real. it’s time for republicans to get on the right side of history. counterintuitive, as it may seem, the republicans are headed for the dust heap of political parties, if they continue to neglect their obligations to speak truth to power. if they don’t, they will end up another obsolete political party like the federalists, the whigs, or the bull moose party. <S_SEP> all that president trump has done is defeat the entitlement candidate hrc to the astonishment of the dnc and her bedfellows in the media and wall street and the entire establishment. trump is unpredictable and a danger to the establishment - therefore in the regime change mantra of the usa foreign policy elite "trump must go".<br/>the russian connection is a sideshow. trump as a businessman must have had multiple connections with russia, china, member countries of the european union and countries in east asia.<br/>we are watching the regime change policy of the usa being turned on itself. <S_SEP> trey gowdy is proof positive our senators have too much power and not enough iq. <S_SEP> trump's tax returns are the answer to trump's ties to russia.<br/><br/>the tables will turn on trump; and tillerson and wilbur ross and others just<br/>when ...the money trail is exposed....<br/><br/>i am amazed at this insane greed attached to trump and his surrogates. <S_SEP> at least comey admitted, and the general nodded in agreement, that if we don't identify the perps behind the election interference, it will be repeated in 2020 and possibly in the 2018 elections. <S_SEP> "president trump certainly seems to have a strange case of russophilia"<br/><br/>no, mr. obama had a strange case of russophobia. it was truly bizarre to force the plane of the bolivian president into austria. a real show of american arrogance.<br/><br/>russia has not killed a single american in recent times. radical islam has killed hundreds of americans and also in europe.<br/><br/>while respecting both islam and muslims, (and yes, i do respect islam rather than those "muslims" who are not really muslims) i do not have much respect for mr. obama's naive policy, nor that of mrs. merkel.<br/><br/>i almost feel sympathy for isis. at least they know what they want. the west has no idea what it wants. clever talk, but no clear goals. the west is an army with a hundred generals and few soldiers. <S_SEP> all evidence points to the donald being in hock to the russians up to his coiffure... but it is a certain fact that he owes allegiance first and probably exclusively to himself.<br/><br/>in this instance, romney was correct in his initial assessment. <S_SEP> the longer the republicans try to shield trump and his campaign from a thorough, independent investigation, the worse it looks on them. they are exposing themselves as self-serving, greedy, power-mad minions -- not patriots, not servant-leaders, not decent human beings with respect for truth and ideals. as has been said repeatedly, if they truly believe all is on the up-and-up, they and trump should welcome an investigation so we can put this behind us once and for all and move forward. that they don't is quite telling and ultimately damning. <S_SEP> i think last weekend's tweet about obama tapping trump tower says a lot about this man's fear of being caught out in the russian connection. many reports say trump was furious. many times the underlying emotion fueling anger is fear. just an observation. <S_SEP> it seems that this story is dead. it is no longer in cnn, abc, nbc and foxnews. on msnbc, only maddow and rep watters, what a duo, are keeping it in life support. trump nuked the story with his wiretapping claim; where is the evidence about wiretaps? we need the new york times to detail their evidence for the jan. 20 front-page story with the headline “wiretapped data used in inquiry of trump aides.” <S_SEP> throughout the national ordeal of the accidental trump presidency, republican operatives in and around the white house have lied like little children in a room full of blind babysitters, spinning layer upon layer of fantastical explanations to cover-up a mountain of misdeeds. embarrassed members of the republican congress have played along, just barely, in an effort to protect long sought agendas to redistribute the wealth of our country. playtime is over, ladies and gentlemen. the time has come for real leaders to step forward and rescue the republic and our democracy, while that is still possible. the mass psychosis occupying the white house stopped being funny a few saturday night live episodes ago and it now appears we may be in real danger. there needs to be a contingency plan between the donald and the nuclear football while the courts sort out this epic mess of truly biblical proportions. <S_SEP> the publicans want to talk about "leakers". is there a worse group on the planet. <S_SEP> russia meddled in the presidential election. what sort of leader avoids wholeheartedly investigating a country that series it's citizens most basic, sacred right as citizens? <br/><br/>donald trump and apparently every republican elected to represent us. the bubble is way off the level on this particular event. <S_SEP> the sixth motive is an anti eu motive. it is both in us and russia's interest to weaken a strong competitor and adversary. as in many other cases geopolitics and economics rule. <S_SEP> thank you to ted of portland for finally calling on the new york times to become more forthright in its reporting of "intervening in others' elections". the times started reporting on ms nulands involvement in the overthrow of the elected government of ukraine, but for unexplained reasons stopped reporting on it for months after her phone calls were leaked, probably by russia. also with mr. leonhardt now going back to 20th century history on foreign interventions in american elections, i urge him to use his scholarship to also enumerate us interventions in the democracies of guatemala and iran under the dulles brothers, and in chile in 1974 to overthrow the elected government. why does not the new york times facilitate its readers' thinking about this "worst case" russian intervention in 2016 by presenting the history of american interventions in other democracies as it hypocritically bemoans the hacking of the dnc. then compare apples to apples, and evaluate the moral equivalence of each. <S_SEP> comey must be a water walker to be able to conduct an investigation without surveillance (aka wiretaps) <S_SEP> yes, it should be absolutely disqualifying for an attorney general to lie under oath.<br/><br/>and he did it so ineptly, very cutesie-folksy all-friends-here. ugh! <S_SEP> the fbi has no credibility. please america. don't believe everything you read or see on tv. they lie. constantly. remember, everyone is innocent until proven guilty. that includes countries. look at both sides of the story. then decide who is telling the truth and who is lying.<br/> "the biggest lesson i learned from vietnam is not to trust government statements. until then i had no idea." j.william fulbright. <S_SEP> president trump does not appear to be very bright or very educated!<br/><br/>donald trump claims to be a college graduate, but did he attend very many of his college classes? <br/><br/>why didn’t he learn anything? <br/><br/>he does not speak as if he attended any of his college classes. <br/><br/>maybe he did like rodney dangerfield in the movie "back to school" and just hired somebody to attend his classes and take his tests for him. <S_SEP> , ukraine attorney general it seems like the author is too eager to dismiss sessions as a red herring. he's the acting attorney general and can probably still impede any investigations. he's said he will recuse himself, but he also lied to congress under oath. the pattern seems to be to lie, and when confronted with evidence of having lied, to lie again. eventually the subject gets changed, and questioners give up. this will probably continue to be the pattern as long as there is no serious independent investigation. we don't know the actual content of his conversations with kislyak, but it seems like a mistake to let sessions of the hook too easily. <S_SEP> thank you mr.kristof for presenting the fact pattern.<br/><br/>in the interest of fairness, the contents of the wikileaks about podesta, dnc and hillary campaign are also disturbing. an ugly portrait of collusion, bullying, contempt for democracy.<br/><br/>we need to clean up both sides. i'm in favor of intellectual honesty in reporting mr.kristof, how about you? <S_SEP> i agree. there is no way the campaign would be so stupid as to have any contacts, because that would look so damning. that's before i found out there were meetings! what did they talk about, indeed? <S_SEP> so now we're left counting on "the republicans who run the senate and the f.b.i." to act in the best interests of the united states?<br/><br/>good luck with that. i'm betting on the "patriotic leakers, and journalists". <S_SEP> interesting and somewhat plausible posits. going a step further, to identify the why in terms of republicans in congress and the attorney general as to whether they care to investigate. it won't be enough, initially, for the fourth estate to continue their investigations while the president continues to berate journalists that show any sort of challenge. the "friendlies" will in no way pursue this sort of investigation. <S_SEP> an examination of his taxes and his companies finances would would bring clarity to these allegations. if the president is unwilling, as a public figure, a logical conclusion can be drawn by his accusers. he is the manchurian candidate, but not with diode implants but with obligatory loans and favorable business dealings, that otherwise would not have occurred . i do not think president putin would permit a tax audit either even the country that he dominates. <S_SEP> is there any chance the fbi and cia are investigating this. stay after 'em. <S_SEP> carl bumba - a hostile foreign nation attacked our democracy via espionage and an insidious propaganda campaign accompanied by an army of trolls on social media, comment section &amp; forum postings to influence the opinions of americans and this is all you can say? please watch a russian kgb defector describe how 85% of the kremlin's kgb/military campaign, time &amp; money is spent to change perception of reality of every american - to give russia the advantage. wake up<br/><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx3ezcvj2xa&amp;app=desktop" title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx3ezcvj2xa&amp;app=desktop" target="_blank">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bx3ezcvj2xa&amp;amp;app=desktop</a> <S_SEP> you forgot the bank of cyprus. keep on this. citizens are counting on the press and intelligence agencies to follow the money. <S_SEP> , comparison between russian and mexican illegals in usa let's compare the number of russian citizens in america illegally who voted for trump to the number of mexican citizens in america illegally who voted for hillary and we'll see which country is deserving of the nuclear first strike the democrats so desperately want <S_SEP> if you had any honor left mr. comey, you'd recuse yourself and hire a real american patriot to investigate.<br/><br/>you amd your once honorable bureau have about as much credibility left as the draft dodging coward in the oval office.<br/><br/>be a man for once comey and step aside. <S_SEP> congressional republicans would burn down the white house if it forwarded their mission. <br/><br/>they are quite prepared and moneyed up. <br/><br/>we must be vigilant. <br/><br/>deflection from russian interference yesterday shows clearly their intent. <br/><br/>they will fight independent prosecution to the last bullet. <S_SEP> just imagine, if all this were to be true. for the sake of what is good and right, the allegation of collusion with the kremlin must be proven or disproven. keep on asking questions and don't stop until everyone is satisfied that truth has seen the light. <S_SEP> business conspiracies other than loans also abound.for example, lifting sanctions in return for business opportunities in oil, hotels etc. <S_SEP> with the chaos created by trump, his mendacious presidential and campaign staff, our enemies now act with a sense of impunity: n. korea fires more rockets, we have a terrorist airline threat ongoing (viz the newly announced restrictions), and what is putin doing under the covers. besides laughing.<br/><br/>shapiro's comments about trump's two-faced interactions and betrayals of relationships are borne out by his post-merkel-meeting tweets re germany owing "yuge" payments to the us for defense spending.<br/><br/>we must pray for impeachment in 2019. <S_SEP> i take it you hold to the theory of "no harm, no foul." russia can interfere all it wants, and possibly buy a candidate, but as long as the candidate with the most electoral college votes becomes the president, there's no harm done? <S_SEP> , bannon don't be too dismissive of the sessions role. the emily bazelon long article in the magazine a couple of weeks ago provides a much deeper and more worrying/sinister look into the role of sessions in conjunction with bannon and miller. <br/><br/>i agree there isn't a clear picture, but that is exactly what we need, republican recalcitrance nonwithstanding. how far will ryan and mcconnell go in their dash to destroy the government before they realize our whole democracy is at risk. aren't there any republicans willing to defend the nation? <S_SEP> the fbi hasn't a clue as to what it's doing. <S_SEP> and today we're going to let his pick for the supreme court get a coronation ? <br/><br/>sorry, until this investigation is complete with a full exoneration, he can't be allowed to shape the highest court of justice in the land. <br/><br/>a dark legacy that will stain our history for decades. <S_SEP> president trump's twitter account is probably a better window into his state of mind than his public persona. it is not comforting sight. he proves over and over his mental and emotional unfitness to hold this office. on the basis of the inappropriateness of his twitter utterings a case could be made for his mental unfitness. in fact, just using twitter the way he does in his present position is an insult to all who respect the position, if not the man. <br/><br/>trump is not interested in governing. he is interested only in putting on a "great show" and satisfying his insatiable need for "approval". his grasp on truth is nonexistent and it will soon be apparent to even his supporters that his grasp on reality is tenuous and that this poses an existential danger to not only the united states but the world. i pray there are still some republican patriots left in congress who have enough courage to stop and think, 'what are we doing?" <S_SEP> he cannot discuss details of an active investigation, and what we want to know is the subject of one of them. <S_SEP> and let's not forget the other dot - the only party policy trump insisted on changing at the time of the republican convention was that the party did not advocate for arming the ukrainians in their battle against pro-russian separatists - nb - this was his only change to party policy! <S_SEP> donald trump behaves exactly the way one would expect a guilty person to behave. it is the only assumption that makes any sense of his behavior. <S_SEP> indeed: we need an independent prosecutor and a select committee. nothing else will do. all in congress should support this, as each took an oath to protect us from enemies foreign and domestic. time to act on what you promised. <S_SEP> they actually didn't even have primary elections in the past. primary elections are party functions and not part of the regular election. <S_SEP> the republican party will never be able to live down the stain of putting party before country in its disgraceful support and enabling of a pathological liar whose daily tweet storms show him to be totally unfit for the office of president. whether trump's campaign colluded with the russians is almost irrelevant. even putin by now must realize that the man he so wanted to defeat hrc is seriously deranged and completely untrustworthy, whether as an ally or enemy. trump has made our country the laughing stock of the world and must be removed from office before he does further harm to our national security. <S_SEP> you call him smart, but the entire flynn affair does not have any "smart" behind it. <S_SEP> @lawrence,<br/>you are absolutely right in everything you say. i was merely being sarcastic about brushing off the 45th's contacts with russian officials. i didn't say it very well so i'll take the hits, but no, i agree with you that we cannot take this president's word at all. he hasn't earned our trust. i appreciate your point of view and reply. <S_SEP> i can't read these hysterical distortions about what really happened at the dnc and say nothing. "crushing" bernie sanders? who "crushed" bernie? the writer really needs to learn how to use google before she lambastes the dnc and hillary clinton for things they did not do. i googled this phrase, "what did wikileaks documents really say about dnc", and got a ton of right wing hate sites expressing the unfounded allegations, without evidence that this writer expresses. i also found an apolitical, non-partisan if you prefer, site which laid out superbly referenced facts and logical conclusions. here it is if anyone cares. <br/><br/><a href="http://www.mediaite.com/online/heres-what-the-leaked-dnc-emails-actually-show/amp/" title="http://www.mediaite.com/online/heres-what-the-leaked-dnc-emails-actually-show/amp/" target="_blank">http://www.mediaite.com/online/heres-what-the-leaked-dnc-emails-actually...</a><br/><br/>the bottom line is that two senior people in the dnc expressed a distaste for bernie especially after his unsubstantiated accusations made toward the dnc. there is no evidence to prove that the dnc was "against bernie from day one". furthermore and most importantly the article demonstrates that the dislike for bernie expressed by two individuals within the dnc was never acted upon. it also addresses the spurious claims made about debate schedules and what bernie supporters were saying about his chances at the time the emails in question were sent. it demonstrates that there is no evidence to show that anyone wanted to "crush" bernie. i hope this demonstrates that it takes less than five minutes to do some basic research before writing comments which are so easily refuted. <S_SEP> i find it interesting that in all the discussion about investigating russia and one of the presidential candidates in the nov 2016 election that only a single candidate is mentioned. were there not a number of candidates? do they not warrant being investigated? or has the conclusion already been reached and all that is left is to gather evidence for that conclusion? <S_SEP> given tillerson's lifelong connection to the oil industry, and being a receipiant of the russian medal of honor -- it's not too odd. <S_SEP> will republican congressmen put country before politics and power? why should this even be a question in 2017? <S_SEP> i concur that president trump's behavior radiates just how unfit he is to serve as president of the united states. an independent counsel should be appointed to investigate the relationship between the trump campaign and the russian government. an additional independent counsel needs to be appointed to assess president trump's psychological state and sanity. <S_SEP> there's nothing mutually exclusive about these five hypothesized causes, however much the separate presentation of each of the driveway dispose a reader to think of them as as alternatives. there is, nothing about the first and last two that should distract from.the likelihood that the third is central: unlikely that continuous wh contact with russians amidst russian aid for the trump campaign would not have involved some back and forth about the campaign aid. <S_SEP> we can`t be far now from a full-blown nuclear war - propaganda has not reached such a pitch since the mccarthy years. how the liberal media has changed since then! what happened? <S_SEP> we should also focus on what rex tillerson is doing to the department of state. in short, he is gutting it, most likely in order to cozy up to russian interests quietly and without interference from loyal apolitical department staff and the public eye. don't let these treasonistas get away with the theft of our democracy. we depend on the fourth estate to deliver us from these criminals. <S_SEP> you may or may not believe that some people have psychic abilities to foretell the future. but i have known three area "psychics" for years who have been used by several police departments to locate missing persons and/or solve crimes with amazing success. all three have told me donald trump will not finish his term for reasons they do not know. i was told this months ago.<br/>poetic justice? karma? <S_SEP> perhaps it is because in putin trump sees himself. the strong boss man who weeks out corruption that suits his fancy not the nations. when you lie down with dogs you run the risk of getting fleas. don't know who brings them to the mat but one can be assured both will have them before this relationship ends. <S_SEP> , russia and ukraine affair, trump and putin affair not sure why you would believe something "less transactional" happened between trump and putin; trump is known as "mr. transactional." perhaps neither believed he could ever be elected, but... then mr. comey came along and gave the needed 11th hour push. <S_SEP> , ivanka and george conway wow. tillerson, the oil man decides to go to russia. surprise! so dump thinks that they will get away with all of this? i sure hope not. even without a prosecutor, which i am praying for, this freak has so many enemies that they will do him in.<br/>so now ivanka dump and george conway are getting jobs in the wh? there is no way that this is not nepotism but the dumpsters in ky will never believe you. <S_SEP> no, trump, the lying, conning, groper in chief, is bad for our country. very bad. and hillary clinton was not corrupt. she duly reported her speaking fees in her tax returns (trump still has to show his), paid taxes over them and gave part of it to charity. you should grow up. millions more voted for hillary clinton than for trump. <S_SEP> , russia and trump the rights obsession with the liberal media obscures the primary point. liberals are not obsessed with trump and russia, we're obsessed with having a president who has been bought. a president controlled by any other government, especially a government and by somebody who would happily murder you and me if he didn't like you, is dangerous for all of us, including you. that you can't see this is the most worrisome part of all of it. wake up, dady dude. <S_SEP> , the department of education, russia and texas relations, roe v. wade, epa, aca writing from deep in the heart of texas, i cannot describe how discouraging it is to write and call our strictly republican representatives about this matter and receive nothing but a steady stream of deflecting letters and emails in reply, along with requests for donations. as if i would ever donate anything to these do-nothing-but-harm cadre of political hacks -- who really don't need my measly five bucks, because they are bought and paid for by big business and mega-churches, anyway! <br/><br/>from the standpoint here, the situation with the president and russia seems like a hopeless cause, because no republican is going to attack him as long as he will sign their legislation gutting roe v. wade, the aca, the epa, the department of education, and anything else their corporate and church masters want to get rid of.. <S_SEP> sticks and stones, sticks and stones. kristof may sound like a nut job to you, but he is voicing the concerns of many, even conservatives. you, however, sound gullible. <S_SEP> , bank of cyprus pcl, russians, cyprus yes, i saw that . she then connected it farther when she explained how he russian guy who was ceo of deutsche bank was let go when deutsche bank was fined 600 million dollars for helping the russians to launder billions of dollars. he then moved to the bank of cyprus. guess who has been the vice-chairman of the board of bank of cyprus pcl, the largest bank in cyprus since 2014. secretary of commerce- wilbur ross. this gets curiouser and curiouser said the white rabbit to alice. <S_SEP> rachel maddow is a national treasure. thank god for her. <S_SEP> you did not include the fact that since his election, trump's plane and the russian fertilizer king's plane were both at the same airport at least twice. on at least one of those occasions, the press were told to stay in a room that had the windows covered up so they could not see what was happening outside that room.<br/><br/>why was/is djt meeting with this russian oligarch who purchased his $40 million dollar home for $100 million dollars when trump was in dire financial straits?<br/><br/>has djt been helping russian oligarchs invest their dirty/laundered money? <S_SEP> this is a well reasoned and presented editorial. while not as accusatory as might be warranted, it is hard to imagine "reasonable" people in congress would not aggressively pursue these various ties. <br/><br/>however, i suspect that trump is much more incompetent than people give him credit for based on his lack of meaningful success as a businessman outside of real estate. also, we don't know the ownership of many of "his" companies. since most such real estate projects are organized as lps, it would be easy to conclude he may have little ownership and instead simply be providing his name. he was also a beneficiary of the most amazing real estate property increase in history in nyc where his inherited properties were located.<br/><br/>seen as a bumbling and incompetent businessman shooting from the hip, his present foreign policy mistakes and reliance on fox news is much more understandable. thanks for making the case! <S_SEP> the nyt calls for "a bipartisan group of statesmen" to investigate this saga. it can't be <a href="http://done...name" title="done...name" target="_blank">done...name</a> one, just one , member of the republican congress who qualifies as a "statesman". <S_SEP> if investigations show that russian did indeed interfere with the us election, is pence any more legitimate as vp than trump is as president? every partisan bone in my body says, "no." but that would leave us with ryan the spineless as potus. can we have a redo? please tell me we can have a redo? <S_SEP> the republicans are playing the nixon game in thinking they can control and obstruct the public from getting to the truth. time and again they have increasingly shown party before country since the election of president obama. if they expect to regain any respect and trust from citizens, then they must let independent inquiries begin immediately. if not, they are looking at the ~ 40% of trump's base being the remainder of the republican party as it is now known. moderate third party anyone? <S_SEP> trump would say it's the first possible explanation. convenient too. <br/><br/>the whole world knows it's some combination of 2, 3, 4 &amp; 5. <br/><br/>this guy could be having the absolute longest tax audit ever. nah. he's just lying. <S_SEP> i applaud the nyt position that supports the appointment of a special prosecutor. but why in heaven's name do you believe that such a person should be chosen by rod rosenstein? he was endorsed by trump for his present job, and he is a republican. get serious, nyt. the special prosecutor must be chosen by bipartisan agreement or, better yet, by the courts. i smell whitewash. <S_SEP> while i agree with all that you have said, i am concerned that t-rump is going about covering most ways that we can scrutinize his dealings either in business or in government itself. he has a cabinet of like minds and he is casting a web to protect himself and his ideology. this is the frightening part. that there are so many in "high" places that shield him. <S_SEP> people have and will continue to commit treason in the name of profits, and we the american people remain blind. shame on us and the selfish world we have created for ourselves. by the time we wake up to this sorry situation it will be too late. steve bannon said he is a leninist, wasn't it lenin who said of america, "we will hang you with a rope of your own making." ? <S_SEP> keep connecting those "dots," mr. kristof. you might come out with a nice picture of a horsie or something. or, if you are really lucky, you might convince democrats to reconstitute the mccarthy hearings (to get those "commies" out from under our beds). <S_SEP> best argumentarium on the issue this far. europe is afraid of this issue escalating because its economic and political stability was guaranteed by the usa against russia. a failing us support will push europe nearer to china, who is a major investor in the eu. apart from economic control, china might gain political influence - worldwide. this is how a mindless, unscrupulous individual can destabilize world-politics. <S_SEP> no one has mentioned his preference for eastern european women as wives. that dossier might have a thing or two to say about a compromised prez. <S_SEP> hold your horses, anything is possible. but is it probable? no no no, that wasn't for upshot. at the moment, probable it is not. <br/><br/>so hold horses, wait, comey will surely itch for blaring headlines again soon. we know that. at which point, who cares what he says. he's already burnt his credibility nicely across both parties by saying a lot ... but saying nothing. this man's downward spiral more fun to watch than a space x rocket. <br/><br/>in the meanwhile, stop peeping into trump's twitter feed. it's for followers only. no follow, no peep. got that? didn't think so either. <S_SEP> a universal theme if ever man wrote one. judge not, lest you be judged by your own standards. comey seems up for it; trump is incapable. <S_SEP> you are sponsoring fake news. <S_SEP> it's not clear to me why msm is in such a twit about relationships with russia. putin may well be despicable what does that have to do with this country's well-being?. how about a multilateral investigation of all candidates' communications with other governments during the campaign? did any candidate or representative of a candidate have communications with any other government during the campaign? how about uk, ireland, israel, italy, mexico? <S_SEP> i would not be so quick to dismiss the fourth alternative - the chances of trump, prior to his political career, being well-behaved while out of town on business are slim to none, even without a foreign government with the means (and the inclination) to set him up with easy women in a bugged hotel room. it would be something of a miracle if he had not fallen into such a trap. <S_SEP> i am not certain that we should worry if djt made a deal with putin; he has a history of not paying up anyway. <S_SEP> the fascist bureau of investigation, and sessions, will protect the fuehrer. <S_SEP> , trump adviser, russian-born investment banker, surrogate yet another dot may be boris epshteyn, a russian-born investment banker, trump campaign adviser, surrogate, who has promoted investment in moscow. <S_SEP> de facto president, steve bannon describes his goal for this administration: " "deconstruction of the administrative state". putin is his tutor and bannon is a quick study, employing decoys thru out his administration.<br/> the dots are connected, and we need to put aside our anxiety and<br/> face our worse fears, before it is too late. <S_SEP> thanks mr. kristof, you're dead on with this column. <br/><br/>and then, of course, there's what's visible to the naked eye, and that has the so-called republican party's fingerprints all over it:<br/><br/>rolling back fuel efficiency standards?<br/>gutting the clean water act?<br/>taking health insurance away from millions?<br/>scheming to transfer our public lands into private hands?<br/>hunting down humans like animals because they were born elsewhere but work here? <br/><br/>only 18 months til 2018, folks. <S_SEP> your point 3 states that there was repeated communication between the trump organization computer the russia alpha bank. so does that mean the trump tower was under surveillance, possibly a wiretap. so is trump statement, at least that part of it accurate? that would be damaging to both the obama administration and the press. <S_SEP> to answer your question, are we a bunch of rubes, well, we act like it, many of us are rubes and easily persuaded with shiny trinkets, so, the gop, and trump, takes advantage of that and hoodwinks us continuously. <S_SEP> this is not a bad case that kristof (russian name) projects -- certainly cogent. <S_SEP> i put aside presumptive fact, rumors and innuendos of president obama being "muslim friendly" to certain governments though his tenure. i do the same for president trump. to do otherwise would continue idiocy and bias of one side or the other! you aren't doing "that" are you???? <S_SEP> intercepts of communications involving russian officials, and by the british and dutch governments monitoring meetings in europe between russians and members of the trump team."<br/> if only there was "leaky" fawcet in the uk and netherlands. the dutch are currently fighting off russian interference and who knows, maybe russia is behind brexit. so much to learn, so little time. <S_SEP> the top priority of the fbi was to find an ffl jersey that was finally located in mexico. mr. comey and his well trained agents spared to expense searching for this precious object, go g men! <S_SEP> actually no, those weren't bribes, and guess what, it doesn't matter in the slightest. mrs. clinton isn't president now, your boy trump is, and he's a traitor. you support a traitor to our nation. someday you might even realize it. <S_SEP> , russia and trump oh, come on nicholas! you know all these contacts between trump's business and campaign people and the russians were simply to trade borscht soup and chicken kiev recipes and discuss the best vodka pairings. it was all perfectly innocent! <S_SEP> yes, we have to connect the dots. three things: 1) re your number 7, don't forget rudy giuliani's gloating over what was to come in terms of the leaks/hacks, and look more into his involvement (he should be subpoena-ed by whatever independent inquiry happens). 2) no candidate for scotus should be allowed to be confirmed before we get the results of such an independent inquiry. and 3) listen to rachel maddow on the money ties. <S_SEP> the fake president as many people call him (so many people) is afraid of the news (very, very afraid) precisely because of what he's hiding. if you're listening, new york times, please continue digging to discover the roots of mr trumpnik's kremlin-o-philia. <S_SEP> much like the 9/11 attack, the cyberattack (and possible outlying events) by russia has kind of reached a success for the perpetrators in that chaos has ensued and our way of life as well as trust in our democracy is crumbling. while i think that in the long run we will persevere, i also believe that we will long carry the scars of these events. just the fact that our government, while often suffering curable scandals, has become a parallel to the corruption and subversiveness previously relegated to news stories from third world countries and conspiracy spy novels, undermining our stability and trust. these are dark days indeed. <S_SEP> the notion that our president lies with regularity is troubling. the possibility that he may be delusional (doubling and tripling down on wire tapping) is outright scary. <S_SEP> i'd like to throw in another theory. this is that herr trump personally finds strongmen and certain dictators engrossing and appealing. trump himself acts in many ways like one. perhaps he finds the concept or a strongman sexy and it appeals to his own vanities. if this idea is true, there would be clues embedded in the 40+ years of deal-making and press coverage. <S_SEP> how does one prevent a "select committee" or "special prosecutor" from an investigation for 8 yrs ?<br/>easy !<br/>don't fund them. <S_SEP> will ivanka ever play cordelia to the mad king and tell him what he needs to hear? <S_SEP> trump will say anything for $$$. being outrageous is the easiest path to diverting attention from the money trail. stay focused. find a whistle blower within treasury, whatever it takes to bring down the moron. <S_SEP> best quote of the day, rocky! <S_SEP> i guess joe mccarthy, like joe hill, never died. <S_SEP> the editorial board assumes this governing body actually cares about democracy. have you considered that the president may be intentionally disrupting the public confidence in the balance of powers? <S_SEP> that guy is a total joke who thinks he's william boyce thompson, copper magnate who made out like a bandito in war profits. thompson's friends advised him to keep out of politics and let the politicians do the heavy lifting for him. this bolsheviki of wall street who cornered their markets gave up on becoming gov of ny and settled on plotting tea pot dome. <br/><br/>we're taking this whole enchilada off of coal and going for the oil booms, baby! blame the oil barons, west virginia! after they picked out the perfect cabinet for this lease acquisition campaign to fashion the entire western oil infrastructure, they picked up harding to front the whole operation. <S_SEP> this morning the wife came down for breakfast and i looked at her and deadpanned "trump just declared war on north korea". she gasped and i relented, "just kidding honey... although some morning i won't be."<br/><br/>anything can happen with a pissed and irrational donald attempting diversion. <S_SEP> gop focus upon leaks and downplaying collusion shows they do not put country and their oaths of office first. no. what's first is preserving their chance to advance their sponsors' agenda behind the obscuring dust storm generated by trump's tweets. <S_SEP> good job on #7 - hadn't heard that one yet!<br/><br/>on #6 it's even worse: for a guy who fashioned himself as the 'rogue candidate' the only item on the republican platform that his team fought to alter was to weaken aid to ukraine (i'm so proud of myself, i managed not to type "the ukraine" - but it's really hard. many years of training). <S_SEP> if and when something that is more than rumor and innuendo arises regarding pres. trump, what will you do with that? <S_SEP> yes, very true. and the legislature is not balanced at the moment. how much will it take for trump's supporters to realize that he is a "fake" (ineffective for them, threatening to the country) president? and how will they react if he leaves office? i fear even imprisonment after conviction of crimes would not dent their sense of being victimized by liberal media and elite, and rigged judiciary etc etc etc. how can we re-unite our country around basic common interests? even national security has been whipped into a tuning fork for the polar opposites. <S_SEP> rachael maddow is about 30 steps ahead of everyone else on the russia puzzle. the starting point for every reader and journalist should be her recent work. she has already painted a far richer russka picture than this article paints. <S_SEP> some of us connected the dots long ago, and i for one believe it goes beyond trump and his campaign. why do you think the entire republican establishment has backed the citizens united decision which allows unregulated, untraceable, dark money to influence our elections? <S_SEP> toward the end of this column, there is one point that jumped-out at me and, i believe, might be a key consideration. early in the trump regime, reinc e priebus was considered to have more power in the inner circle, as there were no counrtrer-claims by trimp or any of his other top adv visors. but now, as bannon and, lets not forget jared kushner, have been recognized as key players in determining latin american policy at the nsc. priebus on the nsc is a distraction, bannon on it is clearly a dangerous situation.<br/><br/><a href="https://thetruthoncommonsense.com" title="https://thetruthoncommonsense.com" target="_blank">https://thetruthoncommonsense.com</a> <S_SEP> hopefully, this is the republican party's armagedden. it couldn't happen to more deserving gang of thieves and liars.<br/>but if right american's aren't slapping their heads at the choice they made after watching this dope opera, it's time, folks, to invest in gold, buy a mountain cabin it takes two weeks to hike back to, change submachine guns on every wall, and then build a six foot fence around that 1,000 acres and unchain those dobermans. <S_SEP> maybe that's why he's being audited? <S_SEP> sounds like one of donald trump's specialties is selling over-inflated properties to billionaires withholding assets from their soon to be divorced spouses. spicer just said trump has cleared himself, so now i expect divorce papers any day. <S_SEP> it might be helpful here to revisit the fbi's voluminous investigation into whether or not the soviet union and its then primary intelligence service, the kgb, played any significant role in the anti-war demonstrations in the united states during our involvement in viet nam during the late 1960s. <br/><br/>the short answer is that while the kgb showed genuine interest in the anti-war demonstrations back then, they did not "get into the voting machines". the american people figured things out for themselves. <S_SEP> dear trump voters -- my stock portfolio is up 27%, over $2 million, an amount you will never see. hey, did all those factory jobs come back? <S_SEP> jonathan, you may want to talk to some of the people involved with rain tv and ask them about freedom of the press in russia. <S_SEP> not gonna blow the us ending of hofc as it's still hanging out there, chads.<br/><br/>but the last of the uk's three makes of the great trilogy about betrayal of democracy explains everything. it's the gas shares thingy. trump's getting the riches he always desired but he had to defraud the usa to make it. fu got a brazilian oil dealall for himslefishness. it made him squeal so hard, stamper had to put a damper on it. bye, bye, blow hard. <S_SEP> yes, because those us rebels needed to be bombed. we are now bombing them too. <S_SEP> nixon said it was important that their country knows their president isn't a crook, with trump it's important that their country knows their president isn't a liar.<br/><br/>in nixon's case, it was proven he was a crook and in trump's case, he proven to be a liar! <S_SEP> trump "...flirts wih the alt-right." having steve bannon as his principal political advisor, with a seat at the table for national security council meetings, sounds more like someone in bed with the far right-wing, not flirting with it. <S_SEP> i am way more worried about what strings are being pulled next than i am about the election tampering, which is worrisome enough. <S_SEP> i see a continuing effort to be fair minded as essential, and the pull of partisan outrage as the loss of credibility.<br/><br/>our election plumbed the depths, and we have not yet even begun to surface. <S_SEP> we are waiting (so far in vain) for the gop's leaders to show that they put the nation and their oath to support and defend the constitution ahead of tax cuts for the wealthy. <S_SEP> , nkorea how about the democrats, even without congress, start treating trump the way president obama, for a decade, and hillary clinton, for almost three decades, were treated, and in many cases-manhandled. they need to doggedly pursue his refusing to release his tax returns for starters. and with north korea flexing its ballistic missile muscles, they need to get after trump's reckless tweeting. how much more of this reckless behavior before our allies just stop listening to what he has to say, stop taking anything he says seriously. all he needs to do is make one 'nuclear miscalculation' for us to be obliterated in a nuclear confrontation. and too, it is also time for the republican party to act, to sidestep the bannon, conway cabal and reel trump in or act to get him impeached. the votes will be there. <S_SEP> ever consider explanation #6: he's just an idiot that spouts random thoughts?<br/><br/>isn't it time that people of consequence stop treating his twitter outbursts as policy rather than ravings? <S_SEP> "nothing to see here, toverishch -- move along, now ..." <S_SEP> this is one of those situations that until there is a narrative of what happened and who said or did what with or to who, it's mostly just speculation as to what might have happened. that narrative will not happen until there is a full and trustworthy disclosure of the events. thus far, all involved have deliberately misled everyone who has inquired. there might be a genuine effort to determine what happened by congress but with the republicans in charge, it seems unlikely. <S_SEP> in any recovery process the requirement is that the situation "hit bottom." if there is a silver lining in trump's presidency it might be that it is the "bottom." <S_SEP> , hill comey's news on trump and russia is the worst credibility crisis since president clinton wagged his finger at us and said "i did not have sexual relations with that woman, miss lewinski". the worst credibility crisis since supreme court justice clarence thomas was approved against the testimony of anita hill. the worst credibility crisis since the 45th president had red golf hats made in china saying "make america great again". <S_SEP> a smart man would say--"i have nothing to hide--investigate, leak, do whatever it takes, go for it"-- <S_SEP> , donald trump the first suggestion is not plausible. when it comes to trump, the starting place is also himself, his narcissism. everything donald trump says, does, and breathes, begins and ends with his own interests and ego. the only reason trump would care one whit about syrian refugees would be if they could somehow help him make a profit. maybe, to get into the us, they should simply send him a note telling him how amazing and brilliant he is, i.e.: take a cue from putin.<br/><br/>trump clearly lied when he said recently he has no ties of any kind to russia. his fawning attitude is about making nice with russia?? naive at best, dangerous at worst. and very naive of anyone who would believe such malarkey. <S_SEP> we need a strong, independent counsel unattached to the administration. it probably would not hurt if we had a reliable and honest bodyguard who secured members of the counsel. if we are indeed dealing with a rogue, alien intrusion into american electoral politics, then -- among other things -- we might expect attempted assassinations (eg, poisonings), a possible escalation in international intrigue or tensions, and maybe even war.<br/><br/>if you don't publish my comment, i will understand. but at least send it up the chain of command. <S_SEP> """"""""""""""" morgan, lewis &amp; bockius, the law firm advising president-elect donald trump on handling his business conflicts, won the russia law firm of the year award in 2016.<br/>the law firm announced the award in a press release last may, noting it was recognized in the chambers &amp; partners' 2016 chambers europe guide. according to morgan lewis' website, the firm's moscow office staffs more than 40 lawyers who are well known in the russian market and "have deep familiarity with the local legislation, practices and key players."<br/>trump tweeted on wednesday morning that he had no ties to russia and repeated the sentiment during a press conference later in the day.<br/>"i have no deals that could happen in russia, because we've stayed away," he said.

(the aid was also a quid pro quo, acknowledging ukraine's decision to abandon its nuclear arsenal.)<br/><br/>the us was using its influence to bring ukraine into the eu's orbit, certainly. to assert that american money and strategy were the forces that drove the revolution is baseless.<br/><br/>sure sounds like your effort to "see what is really going on and not being reported" could be rooted in stories from russia today, the kremlin's "news" network. <S_SEP> impeach! <S_SEP> if guilt by association is a thing then we are all guilty of loving muslims especially mohammed ali and kareem abdul jabbar. so help me god. <S_SEP> trump will never be challenged by the opportunists, cowards, and traitors that constitute the republican party today. they're too busy trying to figure out how to cut health care, social security, environmental protections, etc. besides, their corporate overlords wouldn't like them thinking for themselves, or doing anything for the good of the country. <S_SEP> if we ever get the returns i wonder how long it will take to determine if they are real and not "cooked" ? <S_SEP> we must demand it every day. <S_SEP> when did senator graham become a democrat let alone congressman issa? <S_SEP> it's sad when reality has become so bizarre, you can't actually tell the difference. i used to think that idiocracy was a comedy, now i think it's a sad commentary on our current republican leadership. it's not kristoff's fault that trump &amp; company are so off the wall! <S_SEP> comparing democrats (and other reasonable, sane people) suspicions that there's a trump/russia connection to the conspiratorial mind-set of republicans and their supporters is a false equivalence. <br/><br/>the former is reasonable based on the evidence of meetings, phone calls, business ties, interfering in our election, trump's gushing about putin, etc. the latter is based on a myopic, willfully ignorant mindset, raw hatred and a blithe disregard for facts.<br/><br/>more evidence that they're false equivalents? why is there no outcry and demonization of trump and his administration using private email servers? why no excoriating him over his hasty yemen decision? <S_SEP> the captain of the caine in the caine mutiny was finally brought to justice. trump has many of the characteristics of that beleaguered fictional character. without an independent prosecutor, this story will mire the usa in a tragedy much sorrier than the caine mutiny. <S_SEP> this is like the game wheel of fortune. here is what we have so far - "trump is _uilty" - doesn't take a genius to solve this puzzle. <S_SEP> that was certainly my response, tahnkhimo. it ain't "just flirting" when you're living with the guy! <S_SEP> we have about 45 da's now available: they would make a heck of an investigative team under preet bharara! <S_SEP> would the formation of a trump-kremlin commission be too much to ask? our country needs to move forward to give credibility to the president. the longer an investigation is postponed, the harder it will be to retrieve evidence. <S_SEP> has anyone bothered to check if anyone outside of the nyt/vox/media matters base even cares about this topic? people want jobs and change and i honestly wouldn't be remotely surprised if trymp is just stoking this issue as a diversion because he knows it will go nowhere. <S_SEP> , donald trump, foreign power preeminence aside, campaign strategies aside, disenfranchised voters aside, put succinctly: there is too much circumstantial evidence around donald trump to ignore the important question of whether or not he colluded with a foreign power to nudge the razor thin margins (that you mention) in his favor. americans have the right to see all the cards on the table. <S_SEP> the heroic mole could also work for trump accountants. <S_SEP> "a poor person's idea of a rich person". perfect. <S_SEP> perhaps he should invest in some lovely gold handcuffs. this man is scum of the lowest order. always has been, always will be. <S_SEP> they wanted to win at all costs even if it meant sacrificing our sovereignty as a nation to freely decide our elections. their voters didn't care and still don't care because they believed in the "lock her up mentality" narrative of castigating hillary clinton as 'evil', president obama as 'other' and and immigrants as 'takers'. <S_SEP> i share your outrage, but the network bosses have already "fessed up". they admit dt was catnip for ratings and they just couldn't help themselves. it was donald all the time even on msnbc, and other outlets not just on faux news. then in their defense they cite the election polling which said he couldn't win. <S_SEP> here's the funny part...no one who knows can say so, and if they do, they go directly to jail, no stopping off for their $200. this explains how insane this all is, so i'm hoping liz might give us a wave off from across the pond. <S_SEP> and looked really squirrelly doing it. maybe he is not a key player, but he knows something, otherwise, why? why get yourself in hot water that way if there is nothing fishy going on? <S_SEP> <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/20/british-banks-handled-vast-sums-of-laundered-russian-money" title="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/20/british-banks-handled-vast-sums-of-laundered-russian-money" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/20/british-banks-handled-vast...</a><br/><br/>the greatest laundry in the world, folks! they get out the stains used champagne leaves behind. <S_SEP> one hand washes another and the borrower shakes hands with the lender.<br/>the last sentence says it all. <S_SEP> i understand that clinton got more votes than trump.<br/><br/>you folks now have the opportunity to study an alternaticve way of electing president- in france.<br/><br/>i suggest that the french method is better than that in the usa. that is not a claim that everything in france is better.<br/><br/>so please watch it and think about changing your system. <S_SEP> sure, you're in bed with the owners of the paper so you can say anything you want. but your essay strikes me as another diversionary tactic. don't pay too much attention to this or that. hear me? <br/><br/>they're probably too close to the truth. let the journalists figure it out. twenty years or more from now. if there is anything left twenty years from now... <S_SEP> thank you , ann. <S_SEP> @richard luettgen<br/>we both know lois lerner didn't actually do anything that any tax official worried about abuse of a non-profit classification wouldn't have done. she just had the bad luck of being between angry republicans looking for a scapegoat and defensive democrats who just got 'shellacked' in an election. if i were between an oncoming train and a hard rock i'd jump off the cliff too. but let's not pretend there was any actual illegality going on that went beyond some bureaucratic semantic shorthand in internal emails to cover the asses of the congressional authors of a poorly-constructed statute! there's a reason she wasn't charged with a crime and thrown in jail. <S_SEP> collaborative? bipartisan? shared responsibility? with the republicans in charge in the house and senate? surely you must be joking. they couldn't care less if they kill us all, so long as they get a few pet budget line items killed along the way. <S_SEP> actually, he resurfaced in the last few days, in london.<br/>he announced he was returning to his job there with a security company. <S_SEP> bring out the popcorn. this will be good. <S_SEP> don't need a crystal ball to know that this is leading to a very sad place. worst is how much damage the madman in the white house will inflict upon this nation to maintain his fantasy and grip on power. again, when will our elected men and women start going after him for lacking the character to be our president, and put some teeth in it. <br/><br/>he is mentally unfit. <S_SEP> the most plausible reason. 900 million. <S_SEP> it's not a grey cloud, it's the blackest cloud i've stared at in my 35 years on this planet. <S_SEP> david...what else can he do? do yes is the answer. <S_SEP> our hero obama did more to elect the clown-in-chief trump than the russians could ever do. with just one executive order he could have changed the november 8 results: fire comey the night he called hillary "extremely reckless". cops, even top cops, don't judge. they indict. if no indictment is warranted, then no opinion should be voiced in front of congress. if comey had been silenced, clinton would have easily picked up the 50,000 votes she needed to carry the rust belt and stop trump <S_SEP> correct. "he" has no investments in russia, but he has investments from american llcs whose funds are aggregated from other llcs, whose ultimate beneficiaries are entities closely tied by favors to the russian government. the very definition of "foreign emoluments". even the tax returns may not reveal this without much painstaking research and luck, aided by subpoena power from a truly independent investigator. <S_SEP> that's a really good question. <S_SEP> isn't "trump merely flirts with the alt-right" an understatement considering steve bannon's position in trump administration? <S_SEP> stop saying "contrary to what he told the senate" and call it for what it is, he lied to the senate. this administration's lies must be called what they are because anything else is being complicit in its normalization. and normal it is not. <S_SEP> i would like to know... if this past election was interfered with to support drumpf then why is it valid? it should be nulled and he should forfeit the potus position. my kids and i have been debating about this but i just don't have an answer for them... <S_SEP> dems don't fight - nothing will happen - see you in costa rica <S_SEP> let us not forget that action speaks louder than words. at this point, we have had only words and we need to move forward to the action. <S_SEP> another well reasoned,objective, cogent and civil jeremiad from the right wing fever swamps of conspiracy hate and ignorance. <S_SEP> cancelling the electoral college would be a first step in the right direction... <S_SEP> i suspect that the real explanation is some combination of several of these factors. but i look especially to number 4, the alt-right, nationalist influence, for political reasons. it was interesting that on successive days at news conferences, trump was asked about government policies to deal with rising antisemitism and chose to interpret the question as impugning his personal character. one might see that as a clueless narcissistic response, but i suspect that it is more shrewd than narcissistic. trump -- or trump's handlers -- realize that the old coalition of business and evangelical voters didn't prevail in 2008 and 2012, and probably would not have done so in 2004 without a war. they needed a third leg of the nuclear triad to deliver the white house, and that leg is alt-right nationalism. that doesn't mean that all or even half of trump's supporters are racist nationalists, but enough are in that camp to make him wary of alienating this crucial wing. to right the ship, we will need to peel off those in the other two camps by showing that this chaotic policy is bad for business or contrary to the values that republicans hold. (and yes, there are a few who still have some remnants of those values.) <S_SEP> "what is desperately needed is an independent inquiry modeled on the 9/11 commission."<br/><br/>"modeled on," yes. but the new panel cannot be politically constrained the way the 9/11 commission was. that commission was not a fact-finding body but a "lessons learned" panel. it was opposed by the bush administration initially because the latter feared that it might turn up unpalatable facts -- the bin laden family's financial support to mr. bush's texas oil company, the fact that demolition charges were used to bring down the twin towers and building 7, to name just two, the fact that norad and fema were preoccupied with "exercises" on september 11, to name just a few -- that would cast doubt on the official narrative of events, not to mention the nist findings that "fire," for the first time in us history, had caused the collapse of high rise steel-reinforced structures. <S_SEP> one thing is clear from yesterday's explosive testimony from comey, there should be no senate vote on gorsuch for the supreme court until we conclude an independent investigation of the trump election campaign's dependency on illegal acts by russian officials.<br/>we can reverse the devastating cuts to the epa, healthcare and social services hopefully in 4 years but we will never be able to reverse the life long tenure of a conservative member of scotus. <S_SEP> absolutely bang on nic- please, oh please keep digging. manafort and stone are very big threads....keep pulling on this and i hope and pray the press in this country pursue this to the very end....this clown is completely corrupt and america deserves better, regardless of party. <S_SEP> how quickly our government has abandoned the standard that, like caesar's wife, officials must avoid all appearance of corruption in favor of an insistance that anything short of overwhelming proof of bad actions should be disregarded. <S_SEP> what would their children be like? <S_SEP> one word: oil. <S_SEP> you are imagining a "collaborative bipartisan team of statesmen." do you really think that is likely to materialize among today's congresspersons? <S_SEP> your belief in humankind's capacity for change is inspiring, but by all accounts, the human in question seems as predictably unpredictable as he was 10, 20, or 30 years ago. <S_SEP> "failing to learn and heed the lessons of last year’s campaign would be an abdication of a shared responsibility to safeguard american democracy."<br/>that could have been said in 2001. we did not learn anything about safeguarding our democracy in the interim. we have allowed the republican party to gerrymander democracy right out of existence.<br/>had comey sent a letter to congress before the election warning of the suspicions that had arisen around t rump's campaign's ties to russia instead of another letter warning that clinton might have been in contact with some doctors trying to cure ebola we wouldn't need to be in this state of red alert anxiety.<br/>reading a book review in the nyt about tom wolff's essay on noam chomsky i read the words from chomsky about a "supine press". i am glad, at least, to see the 4th estate awaking (somewhat) from its slumber and taking serious its mission to inform the electorate, thereby helping to insure the democracy we still cling to. <S_SEP> , nra, russian ambassadors another dot - the reports today of the nra delegation trip to russia in december 2015 and their meetings with, among others, deputy prime minister rogozin? just before the nra ponied up $30 million in ads for the trump campaign. <S_SEP> trey gowdy was an embarrassment in the hearings yesterday. <S_SEP> jay, your second paragraph is very true. i don't think today's republican party can create an administration that's not dysfunctional. there's no dirksen, hugh scott, gerald ford, or even a goldwater in the party now. if mcconnell and eddie munster are the stars, it's no wonder this show is going on. things might be better if say, ted cruz were president instead of the carnival barker, but not by much. <S_SEP> except that trey is a reprezentative. <S_SEP> you mean progress backwards? i would prefer not to have that! <S_SEP> only 1401 days left of this abomination. i'm actually hoping he plays as much golf as he wants and holds as many rallies as he can. let him tweet till he's blue in the face. he can't do much harm on a golf course or preening to his supporters. and as for his tweets, no one pays much attention other than the breathless media who have to fill their schedules. <br/><br/>just remember the five key words: and this, too, shall pass. <S_SEP> "statesmen"(and ...women)? i suppose there must be some out there somewhere. now, if only enough of them have enough guts to put aside all of the nonsense about whose ball it is, and who gets to make the rules... <S_SEP> whose words have no credibility <S_SEP> anti muslim policies? where were all you folks when obama sent women and children refugees to a determent facility in pennsylvania because they are christian?<br/>you most likely are unaware of it. our heroic, maligned, but innocent press never reported on it. <S_SEP> <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9c01e4d7143aef33a25754c2a9679c946996d6cf" title="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9c01e4d7143aef33a25754c2a9679c946996d6cf" target="_blank">http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9c01e4d7143aef33a25754...</a><br/><br/>in the last paragraphs, the bolsheviki of wall street suggest russians are repulsed by a man on horseback and prefer a people's pitchfork...so this banker is also a horse's. bannon only wishes he had his stock. <S_SEP> "automatically " object? as though there is just everyday stuff going on here, we should all just be moving right along? forgive my presumption, but it's you that sounds partisan. i'm australian, and even i can see this is extraordinary <S_SEP> nicholas kristof of the times<br/>doesn’t deal in nursery rhymes.<br/>the topics that he writes about<br/>make his readers scream and shout.<br/>but he’s running out of steam<br/>with his trump-is-evil theme.<br/>come on, nick; how ‘bout some more<br/>on sweatshops helping out the poor? <S_SEP> if trump was a child, any parent would characterize his behavior as near proof of guilt. his response to evidence is more damning that the evidence itself (so far). <S_SEP> but why contacts with intelligence officials? <S_SEP> the dutch are not just fighting the russians, but conservative americans are also funding the dutch extreme right wing candidate. <S_SEP> that they will never act out of a sense of duty to the country, or in defense of democracy, is at this point obvious. but what’s truly astonishing is republicans’ inability to even wake up and act out of self-interest and preservation. when do they open their eyes to the fact that this presidency does not end well, and that they’re clinging to a deeply toxic asset that stands to poison their brand (if there’s any justice) irrevocably? <S_SEP> nikita khrushchev was wrong in 1954 to transfer crimea from russia to the ukrainian soviet socialist republic, a move calculated to bolster ukrainian solidarity with the soviet union. most of the people who live in crimea are ethnic russians. now that the soviet union no longer exist, they want to be reunited with russia. as the washington post reported in 2014, “most people in crimea wanted to break away from ukraine and join russia. they voted about a week ago, and most people who participated said yes. the night of the vote, thousands of people ran out into the streets of crimea’s capital to celebrate.” rather than restart the cold war, the united states should regard the crimean breakaway as another consequences of the breakup of the soviet union. <S_SEP> , appointees, gp and after reagan's record, that is something. look up the number of indictments that rained down, and the number of appointees that saw jail time. <S_SEP> through all of this, i have to ask which side of the country the repulsives are really on. oh i forgot, party before country. the repulsives are obfuscating as fast as they can to keep their party, along with t-rump, in control. what will happen when this "house of cards" collapses? <S_SEP> mrs- "anti muslim policies? where were all you folks when obama sent women and children refugees to a determent facility in pennsylvania because they are christian?<br/>you most likely are unaware of it. our heroic, maligned, but innocent press never reported on it".<br/>legitimate sources please? maybe it wasn't reported by the msm because it never happened???!!!! <S_SEP> it's called smearing and innuendo. it is not called proof. <br/><br/>and it is what police and authoritarian states use to cow their opposition. do you understand any better now? <S_SEP> don the con has played the "con game" all of his life. it is finally catching up to him at age 70! <S_SEP> palace intrigue is always amusing except when it's your palace. <br/><br/>we desperately need an independent prosecutor to be appointed. <S_SEP> notice that roger stone is involved with both the nixon train wreck and the trump train wreck? he has the reverse midas touch. <S_SEP> in true house of cards fashion the person to keep an eye on is pence. he stands to gain the most if this thing goes big time. stay tuned! <S_SEP> as the vise of investigation closes, and the pressure on the twitter king becomes intense, he will still hold his hand on the trigger. in his mind a nuclear war with north korea may be the only path to redemption. in his dark mirror he will be the savior and no one would dare remove him during such a war.<br/><br/>please convince me i am wrong. <S_SEP> it's plain and simple...the gop is milking it for everything they can. it's time their constituents find or create another party. that's, of course, if it doesn't include the so-called "uneducated" that trump will be hanging out to dry. nothing more than a pathetic display of a huge power grab. <S_SEP> a look is worth one thousand words, and the look on peter king's face on charlie rose last night told everything. it was priceless. <S_SEP> perfect, tim b.! thanks for sharing! <S_SEP> 4th amendment,<br/>the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.<br/>even this dirt bag is protected <S_SEP> 11. the unexplained removal of the ukraine plank from the rnc platform last year.<br/>12. gutting the state department of career staffers. <S_SEP> any inquiry must begin with the full release of trumps current and several years previous tax returns . then subpoena comey, roger stone, paul manafort and christopher steele before house committee. i smell a rat and it's name is donald trump. <S_SEP> exactly. rachel maddow is on point and exposing all the rats involved on the sinking ship. <S_SEP> from your keypad to god's ear. but, don't count on it. there was an excellent discussion this morning on "morning joe" and neo-con anti-trump john podhoretz was one of the guests. he correctly pointed out the 46 percent of the nation in trump's corner are still solid for him. they don't read the nyt or wapo.<br/><br/>more importantly, dems can't stop shooting themselves in the foot thanks to the activist hard left part of the base. they don't want center-left candidates in "purple" states or in competitive or lean gop house races who might well win.. unless you insult and stereotype middle america as knuckle-dragging dumb white racists, you must not run they scream. they make no effort to reach out to persuadable voters because they are old and white and just "icky". until that changes and the dems become a bigger tent, and stop with the political correctness on steroids (who outside elite academia and tiny activist groups says "cisgendered"?) they will not fulfill the outcome we both seek. <S_SEP> or option 6: all of the above. <S_SEP> oh, and one more: during the debates, candidate trump refusing to say that the election was not rigged (i.e., he knew there was shenanigans going on behind the scenes). <S_SEP> trump's rise to power is resembling macbeth's. the ends justify the means. macbeth killed king duncan to become king; if the investigations confirms suspicion, trump colluded with an adversary to win the presidency. high treason. <br/><br/>from macbeth:<br/><br/>"false face must hide what the false heart doth know" <br/><br/>"look like the flower but be the serpent underneath"<br/><br/>"fair is foul, foul is fair" <S_SEP> if this article was a trial, and i was a judge, i would throw it out of court...come back when you have real evidence, and stop wasting my time. next case. <S_SEP> is anyone surprised at how quickly this administration lead the us into a constitutional crisis? <S_SEP> how well did that turn out for cordelia? <S_SEP> , attribution, retribution, jackie speire i thought interesting during the intelligence committee hearing on the 2016 election and russia the answers today by james comey and mike rogers that both backed up information and when one did not the other would make it known because they were qualified to do so.<br/><br/>also, congresswoman jackie speire's remarks on attribution and retribution and hybrid warfare then after talking about michael caputo were interesting observations. seems like comey was kind of annoyed. <S_SEP> i'm an average man, of average intellect, and average values and beliefs. it's clear to me there is a problem with the president and the manner in which he discharges the office of the president's duties. this is a concern of the gravest proportions. <br/><br/>why does the average man's voice go unheard... <S_SEP> living through history is such a drag. <S_SEP> i had wondered how trump would handle a national or international crisis as president. we see clearly now that he can't handle a crisis that he created himself. he had low credibility during the campaign; now he is simply not to be believed on any issue, including the time of day. he does not meet minimum criteria for honesty, integrity, and competence in a president. <S_SEP> thanks for the summary of where we are--so far! the media does have to be careful not to jump to conclusions--but what yeoman work they are involved in trying to save our democracy. hopefully we will come out of this a healthier nation--and we can watch the tv and movie adaptations of this harrowing tale with a rueful appreciation of how close we came to the edge. <S_SEP> mr. rogers: can you spell subpoena, kids? i see one with 45's name on it headed straight for the wh. <S_SEP> are you calling the few minutes they spent on the tarmac in full view of the press, a private meeting? <S_SEP> , libel it appears that melania is staying in nyc partly to give her a base for her suit agains a news source that printed a story that she was a former escort. she is suing the paper for 150 million dollars even thought it immediately printed a retraction. now her husband commits a libel against obama (not just the lie of wiretapping but also calling him a "sick" person). trump has no proof but has malice and motive, the two pillars of a libel suit. this is our first couple. <S_SEP> could someone please start a march madness-style bracket to see how long people in the trump administration last? <br/><br/>jefferson beauregard sessions iii is the number one seed in the south for sure, with steven bannon in the east. sean spicer would be low ranked, as i don't see him lasting too much longer... <S_SEP> i am wondering this morning about<br/>what happens if we discover that the russian actions decided the election but that trump knew nothing about it: that russia acted without collusion simply to promote the predictable chaos of a trump victory? then what?<br/>being a pasty is not impeachable. but would america accept that she just got played and live with the outcome? <S_SEP> the trump/russia connection stinks to high heaven. while it is dangerous to go down the rabbit hole where everything is seen as a conspiracy, it would be foolish not to believe that there is something there. in ordinary times, we don't find out what was going on for years, sometimes decades, but the strings of involvement between trump, putin, manafort and the campaign keep rising to the surface everyday or two.<br/><br/>the republican leadership on capitol hill has been as silent as a graveyard on this issue, except for a few comments dismissing its likely importance. yet, to even imagine that the world's last superpower could be brought to its knees by a cyber-coup is utterly shocking. don't they care? the answer appears to be a reverberating no, so long as they get their slice of the cake.<br/><br/>this is not some plot by the left in america to throw a cloud of suspicion on trump. he does that to himself quite adequately. it is about the fundamental survival of democracy. if it can be easily subverted, nothing else matters. since domestic political operatives always seek to twist the elections processes anyway, it is easy to believe that some would turn to an outside power to grab the ultimate prize, the presidency. if it happened, it might seem to those involved as only a variation of ordinary practice. not so. <br/><br/>the only questions should be when will the investigation begin and how thorough and independent will it be. <S_SEP> this situation would not exist had the liar-in-chief had not created the chaos and structured it so. that the republicans and his advisors reinforced their dysfunctional structure and then co-opted the chief liar is no accident. fasten your seatbelt. <S_SEP> "people want jobs"<br/><br/>someone who lies about everything isn't going to give them jobs. even if he used his own projects to provide jobs, his history says he's going to find foreign workers, provide the bare minimum of wages, cheat whatever laws protect the workers, or just simply not pay them.<br/><br/>"and change"<br/><br/>we have that exponentially. we went from a system that helped pretty much everything [clinton] to one where the kleptocrats crept in [bush 2] to one that had to struggle and spend to repair the damage they did while unsuccessfully holding the kleptocrats at bay [obama] to the kleptocrats and anarchists coming back with full force. none of these people are interested in doing anything resembling creating jobs, unless of course, you count the temporary jobs of building gas and oil pipelines and border walls. <S_SEP> the us needs no foreign enemies with a cancer like the republican party rotting it out from the inside. <S_SEP> thank you for this comprehensive piece on the subject. i have been frustrated by the lack of this (to my knowledge). please stay on top of it (and report to us) in the same systematic way. <S_SEP> actually, come on tax day, when there is a large protest planned. judging from his usual reaction to large protests, you might get your white-coat chase a couple days afterward. come anyway. it's time to send the liar a message. <S_SEP> , bribery, russians and democrats such accusations would make total sense considering the years of deal-making between the clintons and john podesta. the state-dept. - clinton foundations bribery set-up was explained to you with the proviso that you were to think nothing of it.<br/> just as you are to think nothing of nearly every democrat senator being in close speaking relationships with russian diplomats. <S_SEP> "democrats should avoid descending into the kind of conspiratorial mind-set that led some republicans to assume hillary clinton was a criminal about to be indicted or to conjure sex slaves belonging to her in a washington pizza restaurant."<br/><br/>democrats descend into that kind of mind-set all the time, except we do it on late night television and call it satire. <S_SEP> wait until putin whispers to trump something about the protocols of the elders of zion, first cooked up by the czar's henchmen and dragged out of mothballs every few years since for a revival.<br/><br/>kirshner, have you got your fallback new zealand citizenship in place yet? ask thiele.<br/><br/>and to ultra christian pence, it could be argued muslims and jews are about the same, what with the no pork, the beards, the circumcision, and most importantly for the veep, no jesus. <S_SEP> "the republicans who run the senate and the f.b.i."<br/><br/>while the senate might have a republican majority, did mr. leonhardt just write that the f.b.i. is republican? is that not a rather serious charge to make about a federal bureau, or any federal body?<br/><br/>of course what mr. leonhardt might have meant was: the republicans who run the senate, and the f.b.i. (and yes i know that the oxford comma comes after a list of at least 3 items) <S_SEP> "stephen bannon, president trump's chief political strategist and, after trump, the most powerful man in washington, once declared proudly: 'i am a leninist.' he was talking to a new york university academic who had written extensively on communism and the former soviet union. 'what on earth do you mean?' the professor asked him. 'lenin wanted to destroy the state and that's my goal too,' replied bannon. 'i want to bring everything crashing down and destroy all of today's establishment.'"<br/><br/><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/lenin-white-house-steve-bannon" title="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/lenin-white-house-steve-bannon" target="_blank">https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/feb/06/lenin-white-house-...</a> <S_SEP> kathryn: we do not have a democracy. we have a republic. the founding fathers were very vocal and explicit about why they refused to establish democracy as our form of government. hence, in (for instance) the pledge of allegiance, we pledge our loyalty to "the republic..." for which the flag is emblematic. no mention of a democracy -- only a republic. that the republic has incorporated some values and ideas native to democracy does not mean that the republic of the united states is a democracy. if, in fact, the us were a democracy, we would now be saying "madame president", not "that megalomaniac in the oval office". <S_SEP> if it is found that this election was stolen with collusion of the trump campaign i don't think anyone now in the trump administration should be allowed to remain. and that includes pence. better yet give it to hillary and we will at last have some competency and a chance to restore our international image. <S_SEP> trump was the winner of "a pox on both your houses" when sanders dropped out. this election was a mandate against both dems and gop. and, the more we hear, the more i wonder exactly how has he stayed in business for so long? did wearing a custom suit and bluster really keep this con man in business as even his creditors accepted his own statements of worth (just trust me)? <S_SEP> joe:<br/>no, not really. it is a solidarity fist; it stands for resistance in the face of violence. mine also resembles the shape of the state of wisconsin. here the blue fist becomes a symbol of solidarity and strength and support of wisconsin workers. it also stands for the global struggle for social justice and democracy. <S_SEP> fbi director comey should be under investigation as well. his announcement about a clinton email investigation so close to the election while not mentioning anything about an investigation of possible russian intervention is, at least, worthy of an inquiry. <S_SEP> this disclosure comes with the acknowledgement that the investigation was ongoing before the election. that in itself is enough, given the fbi's october meddling to clinton's detriment, to gravely damage public confidence. <S_SEP> does anyone presume that this is the first instance where a presidential candidate or president-elect or their staff had contact with a foreign officials?<br/>i guess in july 2008, when presidential candidate sen. obama went on his week long overseas tour of europe and middle east that he or any of his staff did not have discussions with foreign officials regarding policy. (obama heads for paris and london, erlanger, nyt, 08/26/2008).<br/>please let there be more historical context, rather than unintentionally (hopefully) implying that this is the first administration to communicate with foreign government prior being sworn in. <S_SEP> , military leadership, trump and co, removal from office i believe that the only way we will see trump and his cohorts leave the white house is under the "guidance" of marines in full battle gear. i also believe that could come with or with impeachment and a trial. <S_SEP> if only these editors were as passionate about a special prosecutor after doj officials did nothing about prosecuting lois lerner (irs scandal),or hillary's e mail sever,or the va scandal,or benghazi.you times editors cannot have it both ways.no double standard either.you are the same editors who grossly missed the 2016 election prediction.and yet sulzburger has never admitted the ineptness of your hillary victory prediction.you editors no longer have any credibility. <S_SEP> mark. being an 'enemy of the state' may yet become a badge of honor. like being on nixon's enemy's list. <S_SEP> at best, revelations force him, a significant portion of his cabinet and the vice president to resign in the near future. at worst, an endless fishing expedition bedevils and obfuscates the remainder of his sad presidency. happy news. <S_SEP> absolutely!! there is no room for discourse in this white house..if you don't agree with the pandering fool at the top, you're out..democracy is built on discourse and diversity. what's happening now is a travesty to our way of life, our values and the fundamentals of our democracy...but at least it's not hillary, the most qualified candidate in the history of our democracy..fools. time will tell, it already has. the ways and means committee should be adamantly demanding the tax returns..but brady is a republican, he's got to tow the party line with the rest of them. cowards. <S_SEP> frankly, in this case the leakers are pattiots. <S_SEP> larry –<br/><br/>you bring joy to my day. you are an inspiration. <S_SEP> i feel like i am watching homeland. javadi has just told the president-elect that iran is building bombs, and saul, carrie and quinn appear completely friendless in a corrupt establishment. <S_SEP> that was definitely the elephant in the room yesterday. <S_SEP> good thought, wrong forum <S_SEP> so he did not have any contacts with russians when he was there for the miss universe contest? <S_SEP> as americans we should demand answers. for those that take a more relaxed position, describe when and how it would change for you? everyone has a tipping point. <S_SEP> aarrgh! "communicatios" should have read "communication"! i must have been typing under the influence of anger. <S_SEP> memo to socrates:<br/><br/>sir, you are a true patriot and always tells it like it is! <S_SEP> i share your anger. <S_SEP> i'm trying to comment but words fail me. <S_SEP> crikey, i meant ian anderson of jethro's might blow me a horn session. confession, i'm getting old. solid gold, dancers. <S_SEP> as a longtime bernie sanders supporter, it sickens me when trump supporters, individuals who are against everything that bernie stands for and against american values use what happened to bernie's campaign as an excuse to support a white house that has this type of taint on it. stop doing it. it is not the same! bernie wanted to build this country and take it in a positive direction, the current occupant of the white house and his cohorts want the opposite! starting with taking away health care from the most vulnerable in our society. <S_SEP> i took a long walk in the woods yesterday. i came upon a brush pile. my dog became excited and circled the pile several times. more than likely there was a rabbit in the pile. i can sit and wait for him to come our. or, i could tear down the brush pile. trump is the rabbit. we have him trapped. it is only a matter of time. <S_SEP> the roman emperor caligula famously appointed his favorite horse to be a senator. mr. trump does not need to add any more to the congressional stable. <S_SEP> i don't think there is any smoking gun, incriminating tape and to a certain degree there is nothing to see here. the president might be a not too bright spoiled little rich boy but he does seem to have enough grey matter to surround himself with people with bigly brains. i think kirstof is right no quid pro quo just some winks and nods but nothing so unambiguous as a double thumbs up. then the slrb, because of the way 80,000 votes fell in three states, won the lottery. <S_SEP> do you remember the whitewater investigations, which became the monica investigation? remember how the republicans just went after president clinton again and again to reduce his effectiveness? how they and trump used the same tactics on hillary to destroy her credibility rather than debate her policies?<br/>well, bloody instruction has now returned to plague the inventor - and heck it might even have substance this time. pay back! <S_SEP> the only good thing about "the long national nightmare" of watergate, is those of us who are old enough will not be so hard to convince that there really are brazen criminals who achieve high office and who use their office to obstruct lawful investigations and punish the investigators who do their sworn duty. <S_SEP> sometimes seems unhinged? i'd say it's a pretty constant state. starting with anger management issues in his childhood years. the republican party seems to be determined to follow the republican president off the lemming cliffs and into the shoals of crazy. unfortunately, so are the rest of us. <S_SEP> do you seriously think there would be an investigation when the show keeps going? gorsuch, approved by his peers as a serious academic, has the "courage" of presenting himself, under this presidency, as a worthy, able, objective worthy person to be part of the supreme court, and sit next to mr. thomas and alito. the shows goes on, as the investigation will....and we, the unwilling spectators of it all. <S_SEP> mao zedong said that the guerrilla must move among the people as a fish swims in the sea. terrorists and freedom fighters of various kinds have known that the support and silence of the people is worth many combatants. trump is not hidden. he is like a great shark, its dorsal fin forever menacing. he survives because many people love his antics, those of a “bold insurgent” taking on the "oppressors" and the "fancy elites.” <br/><br/>once people commit to a myth, it’s hard to change their minds. nyt, your mission, should you accept it, is to those who never read your “failing, lying, fake news.” god help us all! <S_SEP> while trump continues to act as if reality is whatever he says it is, congressional republicans, who do not have the excuse of a classifiable psychopathology, continue to prefer killing the messenger to seeking the truth. all of them act like people with something to hide. <S_SEP> can't imagine why anyone reads ,let alone comments on "richard loot again's "<br/>verbage. the man's a one note instrument and hasn't changed his tune since last summer when trump was raving ' spouting all sorts of inanities <S_SEP> have any posters tried to discuss, what very well might be, the only viable alternative, to the demagogue trump, and his gop congressional minions, taking dictatorial control of our government.<br/><br/>that only remaining alternative ( to a dictatorship) being a "coup d' etat" by the pentagon's "joint chiefs of staff?"<br/><br/>i posted one earlier, but it appeared to have been lost in the cloud. <S_SEP> a watched pot never boils is, of course, not literally true and this pot is starting to simmer. even though it seems like it's taking forever, the dots are close to becoming connected. <S_SEP> it's easier to tip the cart once its wheels have been tampered with. last year's efforts were built upon a foundation of relationships built over time. <br/><br/>if we value what we have, or what we believe we have, here in the u.s., we need to insist upon the appointment of a special counsel who will be insulated from undue influence. as for the ploy to focus upon finding and prosecuting individuals who supply us with information we need in order to understand what is being done in our name, yet behind our backs, let's can it and place it beside the tuna in that vending machine. <S_SEP> in other words, any thinking person knew that our so called president is a rat. now we know that he is a cornered rat. he is a rat who thrives on garbage and spreads pestilence in his wake. plague is diffusing through the land as our rodent-in-chief defecates on our sacred institutions - the courts, the press, the intelligence services - not to mention the mexicans and other hapless victims of his scurrying ways. this rat is exhibiting all the signs of being caught up in a maze. it is our job to stop up that maze, to block up any opportunity for egress. we must contain the pestilence and restore the public health. let the sun shine once again. <S_SEP> i'd be happy to learn there's nothing there so we can move on to other issues. but the lack of transparency by the trump administration makes an investigation necessary. <S_SEP> go to palmer reports and read about how that only the emails but the actual voting machines might've been ranked pretty serious statistics on why florida couldn't of been one by trump and pennsylvania and michigan and north carolina <S_SEP> yeah, and that would also include ryan, who cannot for the life of him, fathom why government is good for all, despite always being employed by the government (will not call him a civil servant as he does not deserve the respect that connotes) and the recipient of social security when his father died, as well as the great medical insurance he has via his job. (and don't forget the pension). <S_SEP> agree completely. the refusal of republicans to take action on the garland nomination (for which there is no constitutional remedy) and now the brazen corruption of the trump administration (for which it is assumed that congress is a remedy, but not if republicans want to preserve their power) have shown one thing: our constitution is deeply flawed and subject to exploitation by forces of ill-will. <br/><br/>given that amending the constitution is intentionally difficult if not impossible, i am not sure where we go from here. <S_SEP> hardly congratulatory, rl. you flatter yourself, much as does trump and we all know the value of that spectacle. i sheepishly admit that, regarding commentary, it is rather like passing the scene of a horrible accident where one rubbernecks, gawks at the scene, curious about its extent. unfortunately, there are accident trademarks that one may come to know and, figuratively, so it is here. they seem to happen more often now, too. <br/><br/>pay closer attention to the roadway of issues and maybe you'll see less rubbernecking. as for trump, it is disturbing to realize that there is little likelihood of correction of the source of our cringing. <S_SEP> i find this whole situation confusing with no one looking innocent. after all, what did the leaked emails expose? they exposed the fact that dnc officials favored hillary and tried to crush bernie. do political parties ordinarily let the primary process play out without interfering? or is it commonplace for political parties to behave like this? who participated in crushing bernie and supporting hillary? who or what corporations were they connected to? removing trump should be a top priority but our democracy in my view is in trouble. <S_SEP> i'd like to think that those with the authority to follow the times's advice will see the necessity of doing so. but right at the moment, the odds look to be against it. to change this will require new revelations, e.g. from trump's taxes. otherwise, it seems pretty clear that truep and his enablers will be allowed to continue stonewalling. the more they do so, the more suspicion there is that they are covering up very serious, perhaps even criminal, wrongdoing. <S_SEP> in any other civilized country, trump would be past a joke by now and regarded as downright dangerous.<br/><br/>evidently, he is not there yet as far as the phoney patriots who comprise the republican party are concerned. <S_SEP> what is particularly haunting here is not the craven lust for power of the republican party but the weakness of the democratic party's response. recognize the opportunity and capitalize on this public display and grotesque example of political corruption thirty years in the making or whine, be polite and lose again and again. <S_SEP> gotta love adam schiff. sharp guy! <S_SEP> we have hardly seen "play" before.<br/><br/>there is the possibility that a foreign power colluded with a u.s. presidential candidate to manipulate an election.<br/><br/>and there is the fact that while this was occurring the candidate convinced his party to alter its platform on crimea and began a public attack on nato.<br/><br/>this situation has serious implications with respect to our political infrastructure - our way of life- and immediate implications on policy. <S_SEP> one can only hope that dark smoke emanating from the wh chimney is evidence of trying to decide who the next pope...er...what the next steps will be to remove our national embarrassment and potential world threat. <S_SEP> i also posted a comment, dave. we're essentially in agreement. what a surprise! <S_SEP> mr. zouck, i would add that there is insufficient push back on the "under audit" excuse. why isn't the press clamoring for the name of the alleged auditor? it is pretty clear there is no audit still going on, right? so why isn't the press insisting that at least one irs auditor be named? <S_SEP> i suspect the other shoe (whatever it might be) will have to drop before an independent prosecutor becomes a realistic possibility. <S_SEP> then why were the rosenberg's executed when, at the time they were allegedly conveying info to the soviets, the ussr was our ally in wwii? <S_SEP> geez seriously. her was great at sabotaging her own chances, with the enthusiastic collaboration of a dnc that would have felt cozy in any dacha near moscow.<br/><br/>i was a bit more haunted by the arms sales to saudi arabia and her's never seeing a prospect for regime change she didn't salivate over.<br/><br/>is trump awful? yeah. does the kremlin love to meddle? yeah--neck and neck with us, all over the globe. put down your pearls already, they've been mauled enough. <S_SEP> please see:<br/><br/><a href="http://politics.blog.mystatesman.com/2017/03/06/how-diana-denmans-singular-stand-for-ukraine-revealed-the-trump-campaigns-soft-spot-for-russia/" title="http://politics.blog.mystatesman.com/2017/03/06/how-diana-denmans-singular-stand-for-ukraine-revealed-the-trump-campaigns-soft-spot-for-russia/" target="_blank">http://politics.blog.mystatesman.com/2017/03/06/how-diana-denmans-singul...</a><br/><br/>from jonathan tilove, austin american statesman's chief political correspondent, 6 march. truth (and demoncracy) dies in darkness . . . <S_SEP> bravo! you have laid out the facts that shame the leaders of his party and also members of the "conservative" (sic) punditry. fox is a pox on our democracy.<br/>he owns the gop but not america. resistance is required by all patriots. <S_SEP> shortcuts have been tried. the bodies just pile up. the long arc democratic practices are worth the effort. <S_SEP> the russians revealed how hillary clinton stole the democratic nomination from a socialist candidate named bernie sanders. <br/><br/>makes sense to consider such revelations as being sinister. <br/><br/>america would be a better place if such manipulations had not been revealed. <S_SEP> maybe i'm over-interpreting this, but i submitted this comment late last night when there was just one comment posted - and it shows up the next day, 800 comments later! i'd be interested to know if many other commenters here also experienced this delay - or if, per chance, nyt reviewers selectively hold up comments to engineer public opinion. pretty cynical (and presumptuous), i know.... <S_SEP> donald fears the internet. someone will have to trip his accountant and steal his briefcase. unless the accountant himself finds his conscience. <S_SEP> yeah, but emails! they might have been classified! benghazi! <S_SEP> completely wrong. there are "rain tv" channel which is extremely critical of kremlin authorities, and everyone may easily subscribe to it. <S_SEP> my mother used to caution me that you could judge a person's character by the character of their friends. choose wisely she advised. who are or have been trump's closest advisors/friends:<br/> 1. chief legal advisor: roy cohn<br/> 2. chief political operative: roger stone <S_SEP> no “business conspiracy” has precluded his criticism of china, for one. <S_SEP> mr. kristof lays it out clear and plain: focus, focus, focus. <S_SEP> i would suggest that former montana governor brian schweitzer and former virginia senator jim webb would be excellent choices for the select commission. judge merrick garland and former u.s. attorney preet bharara should also be included. <S_SEP> i suggest that you reread my comment. the purpose of the resist movement is, in fact, to automatically object to everything trumpian. that approach gradually loses impact, even when a real issue arises. remember the boy who cried "wolf". <S_SEP> dear mr. leonhardt,<br/><br/>some way beneath your amazingly interesting and exciting comment on ... em... something or other, is an article on greece.<br/><br/>as so often with articles on the "eu", there is nowhere to comment on it.<br/><br/>having read it again, i cannot find any consideration of the idea that greece should leave the euro.<br/><br/>dire predictions were made about the awful things set to befall the uk if we voted to free ourselves from the "eu". it hasn't turned out that bad and the bank of enmgland has admitted that it got it wrong, like big-time.<br/><br/>iceland has got itself sorted out after a very difficult period.<br/><br/>iceland and the uk are outside the eurozone.<br/><br/>the countries in the worst trouble in the "eu" are at the edge of the eurozone.<br/><br/>sweden is not in the euro and is doing better than neighbouring finnland which is etc.<br/><br/>so please stop being a slave to "eu"-ism and help to save the greek people by advocating that they leave the euro. <S_SEP> you can always count on rats jumping ship........the question is when...... <S_SEP> clapper was obviously lying. did you notice he never looked at chuck todd once during that interview. no eye contact, just looked down at the table in front of him. that's what liars do. clapper can't be trusted. nor brennen. <S_SEP> john dean on msnbc last night: "i've been inside a coverup ...and every signal they're sending is 'we're covering this up'" <S_SEP> the fraud in chief and his henchmen are a clear and present danger to our constitution. <S_SEP> there is a third aspect to this perspective. why is trump attacking the sources of his anxiety preemptively? he seems ahead of his own accusers, time wise. his obsession with being found right on the subject of his victimization makes him look guilty, but he seems to think this is an argument about the taste of coffee. <S_SEP> you need to watch the uk version, because kellyanne gets hers in the second season of the xeries, "to play the king." am i not right? the pollster, sarah harding, who pushes fu's right hand man stamper to unspeakable heights?<br/><br/>i'm sorry, but only sir richard anderson can spread my mustard, spacey. <S_SEP> i find david leonhardt's columns to be very much a letdown. he lacks something, maybe the courage of his convictions. he'd be disappointing as an occasional guest contributor. what he's doing in charge of the op-ed section simply baffles me. either he quickly grows into the job or he's not going to look good when compared to his predecessors. (sound familiar?) <S_SEP> like cordelia, she would be immediately disowned. <S_SEP> no quarter to traitors....including repubs who don't speak out. <S_SEP> sally yates for special independent prosecutor! <S_SEP> i'd take "house of cards" over this train wreck. frank underwood would make a much better president. actually, anyone would make a much better president. <S_SEP> truism for trump tweets from a third grade locker room: the smeller's the feller! <S_SEP> you had me. this post is actually a clever joke.... <S_SEP> where is the outrage??? if the shoe were on the democratic foot and the dems were doing the illegal and unconstitutional things t-rump is doing, the gop would be heating vats of tar while carrying pitch-forks and torches! instead, ..... crickets. has the republican party become so diseased and corrupted that they are willing to sacrifice our democracy for some money? don't any of them have families that they might want to leave a healthy planet, and country for? where is the shame? <S_SEP> so who do we pressure to establish an independent commission, and how? surely we can create a collective voice for this outside the comments section. i've been pestering my reps, to no avail. not that i'll stop. but if there is a larger group effort for a petition, march, etc i'd like to hear about it. <S_SEP> we need a bipartisan commission on this -- former officials from both parties, elected representatives and secretaries of the cabinet and law enforcement officials. a special prosecutor is too much of a one-man crap-shoot. you could get a great one, or a really bad one. a bipartisan, watergate-style commission is much more likely to get the job done. <S_SEP> but there is probable cause, too much of it! <S_SEP> sounds like what the white house needs now is the exorcist to drive out the demons. otherwise our grand march of folly continues, and where it will all end is anybody's guess ... a pence theocracy? demons &amp; exorcists by the dozens. <S_SEP> i still can't believe kristof won a pulitzer. #5 is enough to get his jurinalist's card yanked. he even contradicts himself regarding the great collusion conspiracy. trooth and facks at their finest. nick must be channeling roy cohn from the '50s. <S_SEP> he was being polite. <S_SEP> russian troll <S_SEP> mr. eisenberg:<br/>what a breath of fresh air in this toxic swamp. thank you! <S_SEP> sure, sure. fibbing about a consensual affair in a ten-year witch hunt is the same as treason and working with a hostile foreign country to swing an election.<br/><br/>not. <S_SEP> "meanwhile a guy in a cave in afghanistan was plotting 9/11."<br/><br/>sure he was. and on 9/12, according to the front page of the ny times, his nephew walked into the cave, and bin laden said to him: "did you hear what happened?"<br/><br/>does that really sound like the mastermind of 9/11 to you? oh -- and he denied involvement. <S_SEP> i remember kenneth starr who is a great example of fake-christian, republican hypocrisy. he was forced to step down in deep disgrace last year as baylor university's president because of ... get this ... a horrible, huge sex scandal involving student athletes that he ... get this ... ignored and hid for years. <S_SEP> unreal.... or sarcasm. <S_SEP> this entire presidency is a joke. <S_SEP> yes, i get it. the oceans are going to be polluted, the climate destroyed, endangered species killed off, the rule of law undermined, healthcare repealed for millions, taxes lowered for billionaires, wars started, education cut, corruption enhanced, blah, blah, blah, but - <br/><br/>what about hillary's eeeeemails!!!!!!!! oh, my, oh, boy, what about em! ahhhh. what will we do about that. ahhhhhh!<br/><br/>(lord, please help the gullible who will fall for vladimir putin's noise. thank you.) <S_SEP> as a 10th and 12th generation yankee wasp, i'd consider that an honor under current political circumstances. <S_SEP> there is no "as if", trumpism is the republican party now. this has not been some sudden metamorphosis, it has been a gradual change spanning two decades and more. it will be impossible for a historian to point to a particular event and say "this is what led to trump". <S_SEP> somebody needs a civics lesson on checks and balances <S_SEP> no. <S_SEP> pence calls his wife "mother" and is a creationist, a pretty sad improvement. he's right there with sarah palin, and when did she ever seem presidential? <S_SEP> not haunting. frightening. <S_SEP> even with the stable of goldman sachs racers, this is lehman brothers, folks. who's gonna pull the plug? place some bets! <S_SEP> <a href="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9c01e4d7143aef33a25754c2a9679c946996d6cf" title="http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9c01e4d7143aef33a25754c2a9679c946996d6cf" target="_blank">http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9c01e4d7143aef33a25754...</a><br/><br/>here's some of the nyt's own cooking on the subject of copper barons making ties with the russians to keep up the battle for more profits! newmont's owner was particular to the bolsheviki, because he saw a monopolist when he met vlad. cut him a personal million dollar check. cheka it out!<br/><br/>my ssmom's grand skunkle. and didn't she demand i find it an honor in having touched an imperial's fountainhead. <S_SEP> bigger than watergate! <S_SEP> 1996? <S_SEP> it's no longer in trouble. it's dead. <S_SEP> pence is in it up to his neck. <S_SEP> pee wee gowdy's attempt at a second big adventure <S_SEP> and culpability. <S_SEP> nothing can be truer! <S_SEP> thoughtful discussion c <S_SEP> i observe two things as i read this: it could have, with few changes, been written by a right-wing mccarthyist in the 1950s; and the picture confirms that: note the hammer and sickle -- the symbol of communism! -- on the placard <S_SEP> @don salmon<br/>oh, so..."infallible pronouncements about the future"...luettgen is doing kinda like our page six president, then?<br/><br/>yeh, we're kind of primed to go after anything like that, these days, regardless of the source or intent. just call us the 'autonomic immune response of the body politic'. <S_SEP> better a known commodity than a madman <S_SEP> we are still waiting for the real story behind the oct. 31, 2016 new york times story, by eric lichtblau and steven lee myers, stating that the fbi said there's nothing there. my confidence in this newspaper was shaken when i read the article and has not been restored entirely. the public editor addressed the controversial article, but we didn't find out the full story. will we ever? <S_SEP> swamp is too nice, it is now a litter box. <S_SEP> nick, you're an outstanding columnist for one unique reason: you're also a first-rate reporter. i know you've taken some kidding and worse over the years for your forays into philosophizing and punditry. not your forte. but when you get on a story, nobody can touch you.<br/><br/>after the spots you've been in, you won't let this crowd scare you or fool you. the line "may you live in interesting times" is widely quoted as an old chinese curse (it's neither old nor chinese, apparently), but the curse, if any, is less potent when we have dedicated journalists on the job. a lot of us will be following you on this story. thanks.<br/><br/><a href="http://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.jp/" title="http://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.jp/" target="_blank">http://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.jp/</a> <S_SEP> no, the central issue should be the nation in the future and global warming and the coming robot revolution and perhaps the fact that we are not in any fashion a republic or a democracy and haven't been for a long time. <S_SEP> looks like a duck, walks like a duck, quacks like a duck. if you should presume it's not a duck, you should think carefully about how you will explain your actions to reasonable people (like your adult kids) when they asked what the heck you were thinking should the obvious prove true. <S_SEP> it may be that he suffers from madness induced by triponema pallidum. <S_SEP> agree! <S_SEP> bobby scott <S_SEP> a different facet of this: why aren't we hearing chants of "lock him up!" from the trumpies? they were fast enough, and delighted enough, to go after hrc on thin evidence of milder misdeeds. <S_SEP> absolutely spot-on. <S_SEP> "statesmen?" <S_SEP> nice try, herbie, really. <S_SEP> where did all that pesky content go? here comes the judge!<br/><br/>page five, follow the property possession trail...when was cameron's email sent tha later was found to be missing its contents, and how long until gchq could return the device to the owner for downloading of same to teveal this missing evidence?

<S_SEP> errata above: would ["not"] be in a conversation . . . <S_SEP> defining the issue defines the solution. if you limit possibilities, you impose bias (intentional or not). critical problem solvers need to be willing to be proven wrong, at any time, on any matter. being sure of yourself is a sign of weakness. <S_SEP> , djt one of the curious qualities of djt's pathology is accusing perceived adversaries of the very lies and transgressions of which he is guilty -- a common tactic of schoolyard bullies. perfect examples include the many epithets hurled against hilary clinton during the campaign -- "corrupt", "a bad person", "dishonest", "can't be trusted" and on and on and on... all these epithets culminated in the crowd pleasing chant: "lock her up." so now we are faced with the unsurprising irony that indeed djt is the one who not only should but will almost certainly be locked up. of course, there is no need to shout the phrase with delirium like djt's own supporters. as millions possibly billions of people across the world repeat the phrase in djt's direction, there is no need to shout. the murmur of billions drowns out the shouts of the relative few. and so, let us each repeat, each in our own way, as quietly but effectively as we can: lock him up. freedom and democracy depends on the relentless pursuit of the truth. <S_SEP> as the joker said in th first batman movie when talking to the copse he just created." grease em all" congress is a cesspool and the only real servants of the people seem to be elizabeth warren and bernie sanders. ' <S_SEP> and what about evraz steel for the pipeline. <S_SEP> eventually it will be the poets who can best capture this moment. prose is simply not up to it. <S_SEP> totyson, i like your communist fisty thing. cool.<br/>is this to remind us of the history of mass genocide under communism and remind us to be aware of russian ties? i agree, we should never forget the millions murdered under stalin, lenin, mao, pol phot, n.korea and north vietnam communist regimes. thanks. <S_SEP> you realize, of course, that you no longer have both feet on the ground. liberals have laughed for years at the black hellicopter and tin foil hat crowd. now you can join their conventions! <S_SEP> i think we you see a potus tweeting about his "rally" and ignoring/not understanding/or choosing to not acknowledge the gravitas of this situation, then you have someone who is entirely delusional if not certifiable. the day he ceases to be potus can't come soon enough. <S_SEP> if a company has a billion dollars in one pocket, and a billion dollars of iou's in the other, how much is it worth?<br/><br/>to wit: how can a sheldon adelson and a steve wynn earn billions in the "sure thing" casino business, while their close friend could bankrupt 4 casinos...not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4. <br/><br/>who would lend money to such, and why? just asking. <S_SEP> why does loudon wainwright singing, “dead skunk in the middle of the road” keep playing in my head?
gp private clinics are being paid to open late. <S_SEP> and yea, my wife doesn't own her clinic, so she is getting paid <S_SEP> believe they are, the phpc ones at least. my wife is a gp at a phpc clinic and is getting paid extra to open late. <S_SEP> doctors at some public health preparedness clinics (phpcs) are also getting staff to perform additional shifts and hiring people in order to extend operating hours and ease the strain on their colleagues in the healthcare system. <S_SEP> the list of clinics providing the extended hours, which is being updated progressively, can also be found here. <S_SEP> selected phpcs across the island will operate up till 11pm on weekdays, from 2pm to 5pm on weekends, and from 8pm to 11pm on weekend nights from feb 25 to march 10.
singapore - for this weekend and the next, six polyclinics will be operating on saturday afternoon and sunday morning. <S_SEP> during the extended hours, the six polyclinics will manage only patients with acute respiratory infection symptoms, such as fever, cough, flu or runny nose. patients who do not have these symptoms but require other medical care during these hours are advised to visit general practitioner clinics, moh said. <S_SEP> the six are bukit panjang, eunos, kallang, pioneer, punggol and woodlands polyclinics.
&quot;we encourage only those who are unwell to seek medical attention. <S_SEP> &quot;we seek everyone's continued effort and cooperation to do our part to preserve our medical resources for those who need them most,&quot; said moh. <S_SEP> moh encourages those who require medical attention to consult a primary care doctor first, and go to the emergency department at hospitals only for emergency cases.
the latest move comes amid increased strain on singapore's healthcare system, as the nation saw a record 26,032 covid-19 infections on tuesday. <S_SEP> individuals who test positive for covid-19 and have mild or no symptoms should consider self-recovery at home, under protocol 2,&quot; said the ministry. protocol 2 involves isolating at home for the first 72 hours after testing positive, followed by an antigen rapid test, and ending isolation after getting a negative result.
$$Other comments.$$ 2x the number of claps? <S_SEP> the extended operating hours on feb 26 and 27 and march 5 and 6 will be updated here. <S_SEP> lol. <S_SEP> work those docs and nurses during weekends. <S_SEP> got 2x ot pay? <S_SEP> yes i believe so actually. <S_SEP> this article is about polyclinic.... <S_SEP> there is a second part about phpc clinics, you didn't read that? <S_SEP> who reads articles these days? <S_SEP> it's all about the headlines. <S_SEP> the staff better be paid for this <S_SEP> something something cannot be measured in dollar and cents <S_SEP> mohh: <em>we don't do that here</em> <S_SEP> kind of wish that there can be specialised covid clinics instead of mixing patients who are at gps for other health issues. it's quite worrying to be in such close proximity with covid patients. <S_SEP> ah yes, give the hcws more work rather than just convincing people to stay home a few days and get better. <S_SEP> i hope the workers are handsomely rewarded. <S_SEP> claps of course /s <S_SEP> this is to support the national covid-19 response and manage the patient load, the ministry of health (moh) said on saturday (feb 26). <S_SEP> and if gps are paid to open late, are they paying their workers ot? <S_SEP> <hr/> 1.0.2 | <a href="https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek" rel="nofollow">source code</a> | <a href="https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek" rel="nofollow">contribute</a>
get the vaccine for your kids when it's available. <S_SEP> since vaccines have not been proven to reduce the incidences of severe covid in children (in the 5-11 age group). <S_SEP> slowly take your time to go read. i have kids that are at risk so i have read a lot of papers even though they are very boring to read. if you cbf to read, i summarise in one line for you - 91% reduction in misc if vaccinated.
$$Other comments.$$ imo, this is official number. <S_SEP> my daughter got hrw 2x times so far in this year and i must say the unknown or asymptomatic cases could be higher. <S_SEP> not &quot;could be&quot;, there's no chance they are not higher. <S_SEP> definitely way higher. <S_SEP> <a href="https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/parents-of-kids-with-covid-19-urged-to-avoid-going-to-hospitals-as-most-can-recover-at-home">parents of kids with covid-19 urged to avoid going to hospital as most can recover at home</a> most children also have no incentive to report their cases <S_SEP> oyk: eh st, this week i no see any fearful news st: noted with thanks <S_SEP> so? <S_SEP> pretty much what the article ends off with. <S_SEP> so just more daily fearmongering lah. <S_SEP> <a href="https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/even-more-safety-and-effectiveness-data-for-covid-19-vaccines-for-children">https://publichealth.jhu.edu/2022/even-more-safety-and-effectiveness-data-for-covid-19-vaccines-for-children</a> <S_SEP> paiseh, should have been clearer. <S_SEP> i was referring to the 5-11 age group, not 12-18.
